Rebekah Kelley: Welcome to the Humanized podcast, all about personalizing your health. I am your host, Rebekah Kelley, and today we are discussing How Exercise can Make a Woman In Menopause Store More Fat, with Debra Atkinson. Before I introduce Debra Atkinson, I want to remind everyone to subscribe and get all of our variety of casts in audio, video and transcription at HumanizedHealth.com. I'd also like to thank our lead sponsor, Village Green Apothecary, at MyVillageGreen.com. 
A little bit about Debra Atkinson. She's a wellness coach, hormone balancing fitness expert, best-selling author, podcast host, frequent speaker, TEDx presenter, and the founder of Flipping 50. She is passionate about helping women ""flip"" their second half with the vitality and energy that they want. 
So, thank you so much for being with us, Debra. 
Debra Atkinson: You bet. Thanks so much for being here. Love to talk about this subject and love to address these women. So let's go. 
Rebekah Kelley: Well, I have lots of questions for you. So excited to get smart about this. So, why do so many women gain weight in menopause, specifically belly fat? And all my girlfriends are asking this question, why is this happening to me right now? 
Debra Atkinson: Right. It's one of the first signs. So even for the lucky ones who don't experience hot flashes and night sweats, that is usually one of the first signs. And honestly, until probably 5 years ago, even, and as recently as today, some women still don't put together, oh, my hormones are changing and that's why nothing I used to do that worked works anymore. Those are the infamous words I hear way too many times. 
But the reason is this. That right during peri-menopause, so when we're kind of working our way out of those reproductive years, nature's turning us into a woman who doesn't need that anymore, so we're going to let it go. We have a roller-coaster ride of our estrogen levels, our testosterone and progesterone levels are taking us on a roller coaster, primarily trending down, but there are ups and downs along the way. But when that estrogen comes down, it, number one, has a muscle protecting component, and many women will recognize it has a bone protecting component, because we've talked about osteoporosis now for 25 years as a household word. We all know what that is. But the same is true for muscle. It's very muscle protecting. So if you don't have that protection anymore, you're probably going to lose muscle faster and easier than you gain it, or even maintain it. That's going to make you tend to gain fat easier than you ever did before. 
So that's one piece, but it really comes down to when estrogen comes down, your body naturally, being the amazing machine it is in so many other ways, it turns up cortisol. And it's doing that in effort to say, well, I'll just convert cortisol into estrogen. And now that's a really inefficient way to make that happen. It can only compensate for about 10% of your estrogen. So it doesn't work that way. But what does happen is we're left with more cortisol. And cortisol deposits fat. So it tells your body, store fat, store fat, and your body can't do two opposing tasks at the same time. When in doubt, it's going to say, we must be under some kind of threat. We're going to protect you. So we'll just store a little here for a rainy day – it happens to be raining here in Scottsdale right now, oddly enough. So the combination of cortisol, number one, is bad. There's also the, when we're under stress, I don't know about you, Rebekah, but fewer of us actually crave kale and salmon. You know, we want cake and we want bread and we want, let's say...
Rebekah Kelley: Cupcakes, French fries, wine... [Laughs]
Debra Atkinson: Yeah. Anything that turns to sugar and/ or combines sugar and fat, spikes our insulin. When cortisol and insulin team up together, that is like two belly fat bullies teaming up against you. So we're down and out. So that vicious cycle will happen again. You come off of a crash from having that sugar, you tend to want more sugar and it can be a vicious cycle. 
So we are saying this statement over and over and over. Women in midlife are more susceptible to the negative effects of stress, and stress cortisol, that hormone, is kind of right there at the top of the mountain. So if you want to help yourself do one thing to help decrease belly fat, decrease your stress level. 
Rebekah Kelley: Wow. Well, with all the exercise options available today, why do you think none of them are working? And, I mean, we hear of so many different ones, right? Strength training being in the orange zone... there's so many different kinds. Why are none of them working for us? 
Debra Atkinson: Well, here's the biggest reason. Right now, and this is 2021 so you'd think we'd know better. We're learning. But 39% of all sports medicine and exercise science research features female subjects. So, if you look at politics and you look at job and earnings, you might say, well, that's not terrible, we've heard worse, right? 40, 60... But it gets worse when you think about it this way. So you and I, we go through – or will if we choose to, or are blessed to go through – seven major hormonal changes in our lives. Those seven, every one of them demands a specific exercise prescription. Men don't do that. I mean, men have some hormonal change. They tend to see it, not until their 60s, but they certainly don't have it every month. They certainly don't get pregnant. I haven't seen it yet, right? They don't go through postpartum. Their turbulence at puberty is a lot less likely to be problematic than it is for a female. Those changes... and obviously if we said, okay, well, hormonal change, hormonal change, but no, you would never do the same kind of exercise for a young adolescent woman who wants to play basketball or volleyball and for a post-menopausal or post-partum woman. Those are very different exercise prescriptions. So now let's do the math again: 39% pertains to women. If we divide that by seven, we get less than 10% and it's about 6% of all research, if it's evenly distributed. Now we know it's probably not. But that's very little research on the stage you're in, on the stage I'm in. So if we didn't know to ask, is the program that I'm doing designed based on research on women just like me, we're gambling.
Rebekah Kelley: [Nodding] Can you talk a little bit about fat-burning zone versus fat-burning exercise and just kind of clear up the confusion around that, for me and for the listeners out there? 
Debra Atkinson: Absolutely. So let's just start with, what's really popular today is HIIT, right? So if you do high-intensity interval training, we all know that burns fat. That's a better fat burner, during and after. However, there's still some very old-school people, primarily in bodybuilding or figure competition, and they still believe that doing very low-intensity exercise and doing it without food – which is a whole other interview, we won't open that can of worms – is the best way to burn fat. And the answer to both of those is yes, you burn fat. You burn fat there, too. But we're sitting down for this interview, at least I am. We're burning about 99% fat right now. How well is that working for you? Cause you know, I've been sitting a lot and I'm still not seeing the results, right? So we burn it so slow that it's not ideal.
So when we do high-intensity interval training, we are burning a smaller percent of fat, but we're burning so many more calories that a small percent of a very big number is still burning more fat. But where we get into trouble as women is, all exercises is stress. So we've got to look at, what's your status right now? Do you need exercise, or actually do you need a little less exercise? Some of that low-intensity walking or yoga might end up being fat burning, if that's what you need, because we need to remove the stress because that's the obstacle, versus doing more high intensity. But if you're only walking and you're doing your strength training – go, you! – but you might want to add interval training.
Rebekah Kelley: Well, then that gets into the next question. If you could give a blueprint to a woman in mid-life for the best kind of exercise, what would that be? 
Debra Atkinson: Yes. And let's agree right now that no two women watching this are in exactly the same status. Every woman's journey through menopause is different. Somebody's journey in their late 30s or 40s would be different for somebody in their 70s.
But if we could say, okay, here's a guideline. Now, it's only a blueprint. What's true for you. Go through one of those quizzes like you were a teenager – if this, yes, okay, go over here, if no, go over here. So, it would be two full-body, total body strength training sessions every week, putting about 72 hours between them, Monday and Thursday. So you want to ditch that Monday, Wednesday, Friday schedule. Don't fit into the clubs' schedule, create your own, and then do one to three short high-intensity interval training sessions. When you start, you can increase to two or to three, as you progress and find what's working. I'm feeling good. I like doing this. No injuries. So, those. You want to consider, you have 45 minutes in your interval bank every week. Not every session – every week. So you could do three 15-minute sessions plus a warm-up and cool-down, or two 25-minute sessions, 20, 25 minutes warm up and cool, and you're good to go. 
And you also don't have to reach that quota. We tend to hear, oh, up to that much, I should do at least that much. [Laughs] Right? Cause more must be better. So we've got to stop that crazy ""if it's not working, I'll do more of it"" kind of attitude. You should already be getting a hint you're feeling better, before you start to dial up the intensity. 
That, and then moderate exercise, low to moderate walking every day. Be someone who moves regularly. That's really the key.

Rebekah Kelley: Welcome to the Humanized podcast, all about personalizing your health. I&#39;m

Support Women in Menopause, with Debra Atkinson. Before I introduce Debra Atkinson, I want
to remind everyone to subscribe and get all of our variety of casts in audio, video and

A little bit about Debra. She&#39;s a wellness coach, hormone balancing fitness expert, best-selling
author, podcast host, frequent speaker, TEDx presenter, and founder of Flipping 50. She is
passionate about helping women &quot;flip&quot; their second half with the vitality and energy that they
want.
Thank you so much for being with us, Debra.
Debra Atkinson: Thank you for having me.
Rebekah Kelley: It&#39;s a complete pleasure and I&#39;m really excited to talk about this. So I just want
to go ahead and say, women in menopause, a lot of my friends, complain about weight gain,
belly fat. They say, look, I&#39;m exercising, I&#39;m doing all the right things. What&#39;s going on? Debra,
can you break down, and just let us know, what are the mistakes that we&#39;re making?
Debra Atkinson: Well, the biggest mistakes are the way we tend to exercise. So we tend to,
number one, do something I believe would be labeled as insanity. We&#39;ve got something already
we&#39;re doing, it&#39;s not working and we decide, I&#39;m going to do that more, I&#39;m going to do it longer,
I&#39;m going to do it more frequently. And that&#39;s probably the wrong approach. So we should be
getting the right support, right idea. We&#39;re feeling better. We&#39;ve got more energy. We&#39;re
sleeping better. Even if the scale isn&#39;t changing and that&#39;s our goal, we should have hints, some
breadcrumbs, that we’re on the right path.
Here&#39;s what women tend to do. We&#39;ve been conditioned. Right now, women still, who were in
menopause and/or beyond, have been conditioned for decades that endurance and cardio
exercise of any kind – high intensity, moderate intensity, low intensity – is the best way to burn
more calories, which we equate with burning more fat.
However. In midlife, that all backfires because we don&#39;t have those hormones there to help us.
Estrogen isn&#39;t there, we&#39;ve got lower testosterone. They don&#39;t help us get the muscle. So what
we need is to get the muscle. We need to spend more time in the strength training room and
drop those fears that we&#39;re going to bulk up, right? And a lot of women still have that fear. I&#39;m
loving the fact that I see 20- and 30-somethings in the weight room now, females, more than
ever. And I love that. But the gap still occurs in women in their later 30s and 40s and 50s and

beyond because we&#39;re new to it. We&#39;re intimidated by it. If that&#39;s the first time you stepped into
a gym, it doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re a CEO of your life everywhere else. If you step here and you&#39;re
intimidated, it&#39;s still a first time. So we need to shift that. Less endurance exercise, more
strength training exercise.
And the reason is, less endurance because endurance exercise will spike cortisol. After about an
hour, definitely 75 minutes, we see cortisol continue to go up and it doesn&#39;t have a
corresponding down. It just stays up, which means you&#39;re storing fat. We need to switch that
time and do strength training so we can gain the lean muscle tissue that boosts metabolism.
And strength training tends not to have that sharp spike for cortisol. So it&#39;s actually a way to
feel more powerful inside and outside and get the results you want.
The last one came up this past year during the pandemic. So, what women had been told also,
this is a hangover from actually the late &#39;80s – moderate exercise. You know, you&#39;ve heard, all
things in moderation. Including our exercise. That has been replaced by science so many times,
but we still default to that old dogma. And unfortunately doctors still will give that advice if
they themselves are not more schooled or regular exercisers themselves. They&#39;re still saying
moderate exercise, because it&#39;s a safe answer to give their clients and not get too specific. But
here&#39;s the real way we turn that around and make it true. We need moderate amounts of all
kinds of intensity of exercise. We need moderate amounts of low intensity and really high
intensity. We need to get breathless.
Rebekah Kelley: I love that. How much does timing of exercise matter? I mean, obviously, the
best time to exercise is going to be when you&#39;re going to do it, but does timing make a
difference? Is there actually a better time to go do some exercise?
Debra Atkinson: Yeah. Love you, but I&#39;m going to argue with you. [Both laugh] So, here&#39;s what
we do know. In menopause, midlife, it changes. And it may actually be opposite that. The best
time to exercise is dependent on the type of exercise you&#39;re going to do. So, one of the mantras
at Flipping 50 is, &quot;Intense early, light late.&quot; To remember that little alliteration. But here&#39;s why.
You want to work with your hormones, not against them. So, cortisol naturally, if it&#39;s working
correctly – and that&#39;s not true for everybody – is highest in the morning at 8:00 am. That should
be what, if you could not get up to that alarm clock, if you could wake up naturally, it would be
cortisol that&#39;s waking you up. Most of us will probably agree we&#39;re more productive, we&#39;re
better thinkers, we do the creative stuff early in the day because... we can get things done in
the afternoon, but we may not have that creativity. We just don&#39;t have that kind of focus the
way we did earlier. That&#39;s thank you to cortisol. So it&#39;s a good guy as well as a bad one. But we
want to exercise when our cortisol is high because it&#39;s also our energy hormone. And the reason
is, if you exercise late day, say you get off at 5:00 and you do that high-intensity workout that
was scheduled, and you do it at 5:30 pm, your body is already low on cortisol. You&#39;re preparing
for relaxing and calmly getting yourself ready to sleep, which is as it should be. But what you do
is stir the pot and your body doesn&#39;t have cortisol for energy, so it says, well wait, I&#39;ll convert
this other hormone called pregnenolone into cortisol. So now you&#39;ve got energy and you&#39;ll

finish and say, Debra, don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. Did my workout just fine. It was
great. But 4 hours later, when you&#39;re ready to wind down and go to sleep, pregnenolone&#39;s job is
to help you calm down and do that. But you&#39;ve already written checks on that account and you
may not sleep well. And that will come back to bite you, you know where.
Rebekah Kelley: Well, and I love to sleep and I know most of my friends do too, and it&#39;s a little
bit of a challenge sometimes, so, got it. Okay. Calmer in the evening.
You&#39;ve also hinted at some guidelines you use with your Flipping 50 community. Would you
share some of those tenets with us, help make us smart about what we should be doing?
Debra Atkinson: Yeah. Well, absolutely. So tenets, or the 10 commandments, however you like
to think about them. Okay. So number one, and number one on purpose is, &quot;Restore before
more.&quot; We are all more likely, if we feel like we&#39;re gaining weight, we can&#39;t lose the weight or
we&#39;re getting into belly fat or cellulite, we&#39;re more likely to try to do more, even though we&#39;re
exhausted. And that exhaustion is telling you that your adrenal system may not be working
ideally, your cortisol is amped or imbalanced, and we&#39;re not going to make it better by doing
more and adding more exhaustion to it.
So you&#39;ve got... you&#39;re driving down an interstate and there&#39;s road construction. There&#39;s no
shoulder and you can&#39;t pass. You&#39;ve got to get through it. Go slow first, and then you can go
faster. Right? So the same is true with exercise. You&#39;re going to get better results if you rest up,
restore, take care of them.
Number two is, &quot;Intense early, light late.&quot; We&#39;ve talked about that. So interval early. Do your
yoga, go for a walk later and that will not put you a workout behind, necessarily. It will
potentially remove the obstacle to you getting the results you want.
&quot;Sleep deep.&quot; So doing those first two will help that, but you&#39;ve also got to prioritize it. So
sometimes for women it&#39;s, we can &quot;one more thing&quot; ourselves right out of an hour or two of
sleep, right? So we&#39;ve got to really say, oh no, this is really important. And I don&#39;t need to finish
this show. I actually need to just go to bed.
The next one is, &quot;Rest best,&quot; and that&#39;s tied into sleep, but rest between workouts. When we&#39;re
over 40, definitely over 50, more of us, at least you compared to you, me compared to younger
me, we need more rest between the exercise to benefit from it. It doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t work
out just as hard as we want to. In fact, we need intensity more than we ever did when we were
younger, but we need to take more recovery. So, 72 hours between strength, instead of 48, is
actually a better rule of thumb.
And then, &quot;Go pro.&quot; So this is a controversy with some people I know, but we need more
protein. We need adequate amino acids. They are the building blocks of muscle. And when we

look at osteoporosis, we also see frailty as a problem because frailty leads to falls, which leads
to the fractured bones. Frailty happens from a loss of muscle mass. We need to keep that
muscle mass. The protein is necessary in order to help the strength training. Get the benefits
that you actually deserve from it.
The next one is, &quot;Breathless.&quot; So, interval training, we&#39;ve talked a little bit about. Definitely, you
need to get breathless more than you just need to go for another walk around the block. Life
sometimes is an interval train. But we need to literally reach breathlessness. So it doesn&#39;t have
to be complicated. You can walk up a steep hill and do that. You can get on an exercise bike,
you can do it in a swimming pool. So many ways to turn any exercise into interval training. And
it&#39;s a few minutes, not very long.
The next one is, &quot;Reach fatigue.&quot; So when you&#39;re strength training, number one, put down the
pink dumbbells and nobody gets hurt. You need to pick up something heavy. But you need to
reach muscular fatigue. That&#39;s very different than just being tired at the end of a workout.
Muscular fatigue in every set, whether you&#39;re doing two repetitions, 10 repetitions or 20
repetitions. That helps your muscles.
&quot;Stress less.&quot; So whether it&#39;s emotional stressors, your finances... You know, we couldn&#39;t
remove a pandemic, but we hopefully could remove some of the other things that are
bothering us and/or we find joy. Find joy, find laughter, find ways to offset it, and then eat
more and exercise less. That&#39;s just an easy statement and it is the opposite of the dogma. So I&#39;m
going to repeat it. Eat more of the right things, exercise less. Just make it quality when you do
it.
And the last one is, &quot;Choose joy over calories.&quot; If I had a dollar for every time as a fitness
instructor I had been asked, how many calories did I just burn in this class? Right? You know,
that kind of exercise typically doesn&#39;t stick. We need to choose, I love this, that&#39;s why I keep
continuing to do it.

Rebekah Kelley: Welcome to the Humanized podcast, your health personalized. I&#39;m
your host, Rebekah Kelley. Today we have a great guest. Margie Bissinger is here
with us today to discuss the health benefits of happiness. But before we get started,
let me remind you to subscribe and get access to all Humanized videos, podcasts,
and transcriptions from all of our thought leaders on personalized health at
HumanizedhHealth.com.
Margie, welcome. So happy to have you on the show today.
Margie Bissinger: Oh, well, thanks so much for inviting me. So happy to be here.
Rebekah Kelley: Before we get started, I just did want to share a little bit of
background information about you for our listeners and viewers. Margie is a physical
therapist, integrative health coach, happiness trainer, lecture, author. She specializes
in helping people with osteoporosis, osteopenia, improve their bone health through
an integrative comprehensive approach utilizing whole foods, exercise, supplements,
mind-body relaxation techniques, and happiness training. Awesome!
Margie Bissinger: Well, thank you,
Rebekah Kelley: Margie, you&#39;re a physical therapist and health coach. How did you
get into teaching happiness? That seems a little bit of a transition.
Margie Bissinger: Yeah. You know, it&#39;s funny. It starts way back in my 20s, when I
had gone through a bad situation myself, and I moved to Chicago. I&#39;m not going to go
into that because it&#39;s too long, but basically I&#39;m working in an outpatient clinic in
Chicago with chronic pain, people with neck pain, back pain, TMJ. And they&#39;re like,
Margie, you&#39;re so happy. Had they only known what I had done through they
wouldn&#39;t be saying that, but at that moment, it hit me that happiness was an internal
job and not based on my circumstances. And I said, hmm, everyone I&#39;m working with
is so miserable. I&#39;m going to start teaching them what got me through my situation –
and miracles started happening.
Back pain, neck pain, jaw pain, headaches were going away much quicker than with
just traditional physical therapy. And that&#39;s when I saw the power of what I now call
happiness habits, how it transforms lives. So since that time, and that&#39;s been over 35
years ago, I&#39;ve been incorporating that with every patient I see, every program I do.
And I just feel it&#39;s the foundation of health, that when you have those habits built in,
it can just change everything. And so that&#39;s how it started. It&#39;s just been so
rewarding, and I see lives change every day.
Rebekah Kelley: So when you say happiness, cause you actually... I caught whenever
you were describing it, you separated the situation you were in, was different than

your happiness. So a lot of times we think, oh, well, I go and do something, I buy
something, it makes me happy. We think if we do something, it changes our
situation. But you just said you were, even in the situation you were in, if they would
have known, they would have really... So when you say that, what do you mean?
Margie Bissinger: No, that&#39;s really a great question. Well, first of all, the happiness
I&#39;m talking about is not having a fake smile plastered to your face. It&#39;s a deep sense
of peace and wellbeing that doesn&#39;t depend on your circumstances. But the other
thing I recently added to that definition: living your life in color. That definition didn&#39;t
sound so exciting – but to really enjoy your life. So I think the combination of the
two.
But you said something really great that I just want to comment on because, people
think... they&#39;ve done a study, they&#39;ve really looked at what&#39;s called the happiness set
point, you know, what determines your base level of happiness. And we all have one,
it&#39;s sort of like a thermostat – we can be happier, we can be sadder, but we all hover
around this. And they found that circumstances were only 10%. That&#39;s all. And this is
what everyone thinks, just like you said – if I get that other job, or when I make more
money, I&#39;ll be happy when I&#39;m in a better relationship. But it only constitutes 10%.
So you want to know what the other is? [Laughing.]
Rebekah Kelley: Yes [laughing], what is it?
Margie Bissinger: Well, 50% is genetics, but the good news with that is now they&#39;ve
found with epigenetics, we can even affect how, you know, turning on and off our
genes. But the other 40%, the other 40% are your habits. So that&#39;s the great news.
We have so much room to change this happiness set point and we can increase it
regardless of where we start from. It&#39;s all really good news.
Rebekah Kelley: So – you&#39;ve mentioned the happiness set point as being our base
level of happiness and that we can actually increase it. Is there, I mean, how can we
do that?
Margie Bissinger: Well, it&#39;s through happiness habits. Cause that&#39;s the 40%. Plus, we
can affect our, you know, if our genes express themselves, as well.
So there&#39;s many different areas in terms of happiness. I look at it like a house when I
teach the class. I have a happiness class that I teach – but I look at it like a house,
different areas. So it starts with the foundation. You&#39;re taking responsibility. And I
think the big thing there, so many people are victims in life where, you know, oh
poor me. And instead of being...
Rebekah Kelley: That&#39;s it right now. Yes.

Margie Bissinger: Yes. So many people... and that is one of the fastest ways to
unhappiness, because when you&#39;re in that state, oh poor me, nothing can be done,
versus just a change of mind. It&#39;s just so simple to be a victor and take responsibility
and look at solutions instead of problems.
So that&#39;s always where I start the foundation. Then there&#39;s different pillars – the
mind, the heart, to learn certain habits, to live with an open heart, how to rewire
your brain for positivity (because we are really wired for negativity), connecting to a
power greater than yourself, your health (because that takes care), who we
surround ourselves with, as well as living with purpose and passion. So all those
seven areas constitute what I call that deep level of peace and wellbeing. And also
joy. [Laughs]
Rebekah Kelley: You also started off by talking about how you were working with
helping people, right?
Margie Bissinger: Yes.
Rebekah Kelley: Helping with their health. So my assumption is, based upon that, it
does definitely, if you&#39;re happy, obviously it helps your health. But HOW does it do
that? And also, does it affect your immune system? Cause I&#39;m assuming that, kind of
as our baseline, it&#39;s kind of what supports our health, right? So can you talk more
about that?
Margie Bissinger: Yes. I mean, they&#39;ve done studies on this, which is just so
incredible. They&#39;ve shown that people who are happier on an average of 9 years
longer, and they&#39;re 35% less likely to get sick. They also have 47% reduction in sleep
disorders, which, you know, affects everything. So many people heal better. And I&#39;ve
seen... I saw with my patients, I just couldn&#39;t get over how chronic pain was reduced
and people really recovered so much quicker. And you would see life returning and
joy and, you know, we have one life to live. Why shouldn&#39;t we be happy and really
love our life?
Rebekah Kelley: Now you talked about how 40% of it is habits, right? Did I get that
number?
Margie Bissinger: Yup.
Rebekah Kelley: ...Is habits. So, can you give us an example of what a happiness
habit is that we could use to increase our set point?
Margie Bissinger: Yes. I&#39;m going to start with, I&#39;m going to start with our thoughts
because the sad thing is, 80% of the average person&#39;s thoughts are negative. We&#39;re
sort of wired that way because in the caveman days, we had to be aware of a tiger

lurking versus someone saying, you know, giving us a compliment. So, here&#39;s the
quickest way that I found to rewire your brain for happiness.
Number one. Look for the good. You know, so often we focus on what&#39;s not working
and what&#39;s bad in our lives – but focus on the good. And if that&#39;s hard to do, pretend
you&#39;re a detective and you&#39;re giving out Academy Awards for the cutest dog, the
kindest person, the nicest tree, whatever it is, just to start getting your mind
thinking, what&#39;s good – cause so many of us have so much good in our lives, but
we&#39;re just not focusing on it. So number one, to focus on what&#39;s good.
Number two. When something good happens, you can actually change your
neuropathways by savoring it for at least 20 seconds. So when someone gives you a
compliment, says like, ah, it was nothing... oh, thank you, I really worked hard on
that! You know, soak it in, or you see a sunset instead of just looking at it for a
second. Stop, enjoy it, take it in for 20 seconds, and that will help change the
neuropathways.
And the third one with this is that we&#39;ll get negative thoughts and you can&#39;t, you
know, there are techniques for that. But don&#39;t really absorb it. Accept it. Okay, I got
that thought. But then, think of three true, but positive things, as well. So if you&#39;d
start doing all that, I promise you you&#39;ll start rewiring your brain for positivity, and
you won&#39;t be swarmed with negative thoughts.
I&#39;ve been doing this for years and it just makes such a big difference because our
brain and our thoughts are so powerful.
Rebekah Kelley: I find, and this is probably just a habit again, that lowers my set
point of happiness, or it could be that, you know, I maybe was trained this way, but
like, if I get a compliment, especially when I was younger, I would be, like,
embarrassed by it. But I love the concept of savoring it and just being like, yes, thank
you. Yeah, I really worked. I mean that just to kind of lull around in it, it almost feels
like a guilty pleasure.
Margie Bissinger: It&#39;s really crazy that we&#39;re sort of scared. We&#39;re scared to really
absorb the happiness and maybe we&#39;ll jinx something, but that&#39;s not true. What you
focus on grows. So when you absorb those compliments, more work grows and it
just, when you&#39;re happy, everyone around you is happy, or it&#39;s contagious. So, no. So
take in all those compliments, Rebekah, and just take in them. And you know, when
someone tells you you&#39;re doing a great job with this broadcast – thank you! You
know, I work really hard at it. [Laughs]
Rebekah Kelley: So I think part of it too, is in a way I kind of think I&#39;m trying to look
for, like, the problems that could pop up, right? So instead of, that&#39;s the good thing, I
don&#39;t have to worry about that… where&#39;s the bad thing? Like I got to worry about

that. I got to focus on that. And then I&#39;m not in the moment of the happiness, of
being focused on a really positive thing. And it&#39;s a little like, it&#39;s just very easy to do in
a day, right? Like, okay, I don&#39;t have to worry about this one, but I&#39;m worried about
that one – but then that would lower my happiness set point.
Margie Bissinger: Right. And worry, where&#39;s worry getting you. That&#39;s the thing. We
worry, but it&#39;s sort of like – I know there&#39;s a joke. It&#39;s like a rocking chair. You work
hard at it, but you get nowhere. It doesn&#39;t get you anywhere. So sometimes when
we examine what we are doing and just make these tweaks, we feel so much better.
Why not live in the moment? Enjoy and, yeah, you&#39;re in something great, just take it
in, absorb it, and it will change the pathways. That&#39;s, what&#39;s so exciting. So yeah
Rebekah Kelley: It&#39;s like the fake it til you make it, in a way, but not really. You&#39;re not
really faking it. You&#39;re just focusing on the part that&#39;s really good, right? And the part
that isn&#39;t maybe as good, you&#39;re just not giving it as much attention so that it does
kind of... the other, the good grows.
Margie Bissinger: Yeah, exactly. Not that we, we don&#39;t throw it in the closet, but
there are techniques to deal with that. But so many of us are swarming, and that&#39;s all
we&#39;re focusing on. That&#39;s what our life becomes. So when we focus on the good that
does exist – and we all have amazing things that exist – sometimes we just don&#39;t put
the attention on it.

Thank you Margie, for being here. So happy to have you on the show.
Margie Bissinger: Oh, thank you so much for inviting me.
Rebekah Kelley: Before we get started, I did want to give our listeners and viewers a
little bit of information about you. Margie Bissinger is a physical therapist,
integrative health coach, happiness trainer, lecturer, and author. She specializes in
helping people with osteoporosis and osteopenia improve their bone health through
an integrative, comprehensive approach utilizing whole foods, exercise,
supplements, mind-body relaxation techniques, and happiness training.
So happy to have you here. Please, share with us, help us, make us smart about what
we can do to help our bone health.
Margie Bissinger: Great. Okay, so I&#39;m going to share my slides and we&#39;ll get started.
So we&#39;re going to go over today what we can do to improve our bone health
naturally. And the good news is there so much that can be done. That&#39;s why I&#39;m
really excited to be here and share this with everybody. Just a disclaimer, that the
information presented should not be construed as medical advice. It&#39;s not intended
to replace consultation with your physician or healthcare provider.
So, just quickly, what is osteoporosis? The word means porous bones, and we can
see there&#39;s a big difference. This is through the microscope. The bone on the right,
which is strong, healthy bone versus the bone on the left, which is osteoporosis.
And there&#39;s a couple of things in this definition. So in terms of this definition, it
shows low bone mass, there&#39;s a deterioration of the bone tissue, disruption of the
bone architecture, compromised bone strength and the key thing is increased risk of
fractures. And you can see in this picture on the right, the top is healthy bone. Here’s
where we see the bones changing shape, and there&#39;s also, we see that there&#39;s holes
in it. There&#39;s a lot more space. So it&#39;s just not strong bone that we&#39;d like.
This is critical because so many times people go to the doctor or get a DEXA scan, the
bone density test, and they&#39;ll find out they have osteoporosis. And then they&#39;re just
put on medication.

But the problem is there&#39;s so many root causes. And sometimes I look at it as a
blessing in disguise. There&#39;s a silver lining because rarely is it just in isolation. You
know, if you have inflammation in your body, that may be a cause of osteoporosis.
Issues with your gut, or you&#39;re not absorbing, or you have micronutrient deficiency,
you&#39;re not getting your nutrients. Celiac disease. So these underlying causes need to
be looked at and addressed. And the good thing is that when they are, not only do
you improve your bone health, but everything gets better. So a lot of times this can
just be a gateway for your overall health, as well.
So I look at, I have four areas. I&#39;ve been working with people with osteoporosis for
over 25 years – so nutrition, exercise, stress reduction and happiness. Those are sort
of the four pillars of all the programs that I teach and work with people. So we&#39;re just
going to go over this sort of briefly today, just to give you some nuggets that you can
take away and put into your life.
In terms of exercise for strong, healthy bones, there&#39;s two types of exercise that in
the research has actually shown to increase bone density. Number one is resistance
training, and I&#39;m going to go into that in a bit more detail. That&#39;s like strength
training. And number two is weight bearing, and that&#39;s when you&#39;re exercising
against gravity. So that would be walking, dancing, jumping, anything that you&#39;re
doing against gravity.
In terms of strength training and resistance, it can be free weights. What the theory
is, is when you&#39;re contracting the muscle against a resistance, that&#39;s a stimulus to
say, Hey, we need more bone here. So free weights, resistance bands and the
exercise equipment at the health club. So the key, what I see all the time is that
people, maybe they&#39;re using 2 pounds, they&#39;re not really doing enough. And the
research has been very positive. There was a study called the Lift More Study that
really showed that people with osteoporosis and older individuals can do strength
training with significant weights. But here&#39;s the key. I firmly believe – and this is a tip
of mine – if you can, I would see a physical therapist to really custom design a
program for you, so that it&#39;s safe and effective. And most of the time, it can be also
covered by insurance. So I&#39;m a big believer, if you have osteoporosis to really see a
physical therapist and just trying to figure out what to do yourself.
But there are certain things that we have to avoid because people have gotten
injured and had fractures because of this. So there&#39;s some unsafe forces. So number
one is flection and forward bending, so that&#39;s rounding out your back. So if you have
osteoporosis, and a lot of people don&#39;t know about this, and I&#39;ll explain why in a
minute, you want to avoid anything causing rounding or forward bending. Not to say
you can&#39;t do exercises. You just bend from the hips, not with a straight back, not
from the waist.

The second thing is end range. So doing extremes, rotation and side bend, put a lot
of torque on a spine, where there is some bone loss. So they did a study at the Mayo
clinic a while ago, and they looked at fractures, and they had 59 post-menopausal
women who had osteoporosis. And they looked at the fractures over a 6-year period
of time, and they found extension going backwards, 16% fracture rate. Flexion,
forward bending, 89% fracture rate. This is why this will never be repeated. And the
combination was 53% and the control group was 67%.
So the reason for that is... this is showing, this is an ideal spine. No one over 30 really
looks like this, but ideally, you see it&#39;s nice and square shaped. This is the back, and
this is the front. But if you look here, we see this is a spine that has osteoporosis,
with some fractures. But look where the fractures are. They&#39;re all in the front of the
spine, or they&#39;re crushed in their front. So take the spine now and round it out,
you&#39;re getting the fulcrum right where it&#39;s already weakest. So that makes sense that
we&#39;re getting fractures with rounding and forward bending.
So those are the two things I want to tell you to NOT do. And same thing if you&#39;re in
yoga – some people ask me what about tai chi yoga, Pilates. I love all those. And I
love tai chi, it&#39;s amazing for balance, but yoga and Pilates have a lot of flection
postures, rounding postures. So you just tell the instructor that you need to do
neutral postures, or extension postures – but just avoid that rounding and forward
bending.
So a good exercise program. What we want, we want resistance training. We want
weight bearing, posture exercises, balance and aerobic training. And the thing is,
posture is so important because we just talked about rounding, but so often people
are in a rounded posture. And one of the things I&#39;ll be giving you is posture exercises
that you can use.
But balance is also essential. As we get older, if we don&#39;t use it, we lose it. And so it&#39;s
really key. And most people just fracture a hip, it&#39;s from a fall. So balance is essential.
Everybody should be doing balance exercises.
So that&#39;s just brief on exercise. And then I wanted to go into nutrition. Some key
points.
This is a list of some of the bone-healthy nutrients. I&#39;m just going to focus on a few
today. Vitamin D. And with COVID now, everybody knows how important vitamin D
is for our immune system, but it&#39;s also critical for calcium absorption. We can get
some from sunlight, some from fatty fish. If you are having vitamin D or taking a
supplement, best to take it with a meal containing fat. But here&#39;s the key thing.
There is a blood test that most doctors do order. It&#39;s called 25-hydroxy vitamin D.
And you want to test and not guess – because it&#39;s so important that you have the

right vitamin D level that you can see when they do the blood work, where your
level’s at, and that will really determine how much vitamin D you need. Most people,
I find, need at least 2,000. So between 2,000 and 5,000 IUs. But get tests and talk to
your doctor or healthcare provider about it, so you&#39;ll know exactly.
Calcium. What I see in calcium is people are getting too much, because they&#39;re
getting it in their food, and then the doctor will tell them, oh, take 1,200 milligrams
of a supplement.
Calcium is something where more is not better. There&#39;s research that&#39;s still not a
hundred percent conclusive, but they&#39;re showing too much calcium can cause kidney
stones. It can cause problems with your heart and calcifications. So we definitely
don&#39;t want more. It&#39;s the combination of food and supplements.
So here in this chart, this is the recommendation in the United States – 1,200 for
women over 50 and men over over 71. But it&#39;s a combination from both food and
supplements, and even the National Osteoporosis Foundation says get it from food,
and only if you&#39;re not getting enough from your food, then get it from your
supplements.
You can look at a food label and if it says 30% calcium, add a zero. That will mean
300 milligrams. Adding leafy green vegetables is my favorite way to get calcium
because you&#39;re getting all the other things. It&#39;s not just calcium. We want all the
other bone-healthy nutrients. So very important. And just to know, there&#39;s
something called oxalic acid, and that combines with calcium and it makes it so it&#39;s
indigestible. So you won&#39;t get the calcium absorbed. And the reason I say that is a lot
of people think spinach is a great food for your bones, but you&#39;re not getting the
calcium. So spinach, Swiss chard and beet greens, they&#39;re high in oxalic acid. Not that
you shouldn&#39;t eat them, but just don&#39;t count that as your daily calcium
Here&#39;s some of my favorites. Collard greens – a cup cooked has 268 milligrams. I like
to make it in a wrap, and you can even use a wrap on your burgers. You can make
turkey burgers bean burgers, and use the collards as a wrap. Bok choy is great – 158
milligrams. Kale, 94. What we learn gets passed to the next generation. This is a
patient of mine&#39;s son who, when the minute she&#39;d come home from the grocery
store, Did you get kale, did you get kale? Because kale chips were his favorite treats.
Magnesium. This is essential. Because again, a lot of doctors will just say calcium and
vitamin D. You MUST have the magnesium for calcium absorption. It also helps with
relaxation, constipation... and most people are deficient. This is the RDA – 320 for
women, 420 for men. However, most doctors... it used to be a one-to-one ratio. You
know, in primitive cultures, that&#39;s what it was when we farmed the land, one-to-one
calcium to magnesium. But now most people feel at least 50%. So if you&#39;re getting a

thousand magnesium, at least – I mean a thousand calcium, at least 50 [500]
magnesium. And these are just some foods that are high in magnesium: pumpkin,
pumpkin seeds, cacao powder, black beans.
The other one I want to mention, because this is overlooked and essential –
everyone should have vitamin K2. It activates two proteins. One&#39;s called osteocalcin,
which makes sure that the calcium gets into your bones and teeth. And the other
one is called the Gla-protein. That takes the calcium out of the soft tissues, out of
places it&#39;s not supposed to be, so that we&#39;re not going to have those problems with
too much calcium.
So this K2 is essential, especially if people are on very high- dose vitamin D these
days. You really want to make sure you get your K2. And these are just some foods
high in it. The best food – in Japan, they have something called natto. It&#39;s sort of
slimy and doesn&#39;t taste good, so no one I know eats it. I have one patient who eats it.
But areas in Japan where natto is high, significantly reduced incidents of
osteoporosis. So you can get vitamin K2 from animal foods, you know, like egg yolks,
chicken breasts, or you can get it from fermented foods, like sauerkraut. But most
people don&#39;t get enough unless you eat natto in your food. So it is something I
suggest getting supplemented. Again, talk to your doctors. But there&#39;s two types.
There&#39;s MK4 , which is from natto and – I&#39;m sorry, MK4 is synthetic and MK7 is
fermented. So I&#39;m a big believer. I personally like the MK7, but, very important to get
your K2. And this study was done showing 3 years of people who supplemented 180
micrograms had decreased bone loss of the lumbar spine and femoral neck,
improved bone strength and decreased loss of thoracic vertebral height. So there&#39;s
real research on this and I think it&#39;s becoming more and more popular, but it&#39;s not
something most doctors are ordering.
And lastly, I want to say, about optimizing digestion, it&#39;s good to eat the food, but we
need to also digest it. So if you have any digestive issues, you really should take care
of that and make sure you&#39;re chewing, make sure you&#39;re relaxed when you&#39;re eating.
And stress in our bones. So what happens is, cortisol is a stress hormone, and it
actually causes a reduction in bone density because it reduces the activity of the
osteoblasts. And they&#39;ve done studies on this, on humans and animals, showing the
relationship between reduced bone density and stress.
So stress is everywhere, that&#39;s a problem. But my first tip, and again, I can speak
hours on stress, but the best thing to start with, and I start here with everyone, is
just doing some nice, deep breathing before you eat because it will relax you, you&#39;ll
be able to absorb your food better, and it forces you sort of... you&#39;re eating three
times a day so you&#39;ll remember, we all eat, that you can do some deep breathing. It’ll
remind you to do that.

And lastly, happiness, since I teach happiness. They&#39;ve done studies showing that life
satisfaction predicted bone loss. So by increasing your happiness, you can improve
your bones. So how great is that? And one easy technique is just to start looking for
the good, and when something good happens, savor it for 20 seconds.
So I hope you can use all these techniques. It&#39;s just the beginning. There&#39;s a lot more
information you can find on my website at MargieBissinger.com, as well as on the
notes here for the Humanized podcasts. There&#39;s going to be a special gift for posture
of how you can do easy exercises to improve your posture, which is so important for
our bones, and to exercise in good posture. So I&#39;ll have all of that for you.
So do pay attention to your bones because you have them for your life, and there&#39;s
so much we can do. That&#39;s the really good news. So that as you get older, you can
enjoy your life. You can really live, do, travel and be active, as well. So it&#39;s a win-win
situation. So thanks so much for having me.

Rebekah Kelley: Welcome to the Humanized podcast, all about personalizing your health. I am
your host, Rebekah Kelley, and today we&#39;ll be discussing Diet and Menopause: How and What
to Eat, with Dr. Anna Cabeca. Before I introduce Dr. Cabeca, I want to remind everyone to
subscribe and get all of our variety of casts in audio, video and transcription at
HumanizedHealth.com. I&#39;d also like to thank our lead sponsor, Village Green Apothecary, at
MyVillageGreen.com.
A little bit about Dr. Anna. She is a board certified, a triple board certified and fellow of
gynecology and obstetrics, integrative medicine, and anti-aging and regenerative medicine.
Nationally known as “the girlfriend&#39;s doctor,” Dr. Anna is a passionate health advocate for
women, helping them to truly thrive in body, mind and spirit. She is the author of two highly
acclaimed books, created several popular virtual transformation programs, created several top-
selling health products, and a sought-after lecturer throughout the world.
Thank you so much for being with us, Dr. Anna, we&#39;re so thrilled. I&#39;m thrilled.
Anna Cabeca: Well, I am thrilled too, it&#39;s a privilege. Thanks for having me.
Rebekah Kelley: So, I just want to jump right in. Our hormones, what are they, how do they
influence our health and how do they change as we age, especially as it relates to menopause?
Anna Cabeca: You know, it&#39;s really important to understand. Hormones, we&#39;ve known them to
be chemical messengers and they interact with all different parts of our body. I mean, like a
ping pong effect, if you will. Or pin ball, sometimes it may feel like. But hormones are really
these energetic messengers. And that&#39;s why it&#39;s so frustrating for women, for us, when we go to
our doctor and they said, we really can&#39;t test them. And that&#39;s the truth, because even if we&#39;re
looking at saliva, urine, blood, and when we look at all three ways in the functional approach,
and until we really understand the energetic component and the energetic way to test them –
and I look forward to that day where... we kind of missed the boat on really getting a clear
picture of how our hormones are interacting with each other. But the mystery is unfolding. And
for women, we focus a lot on our reproductive hormones, you know, estrogen, progesterone,
testosterone, and even DHEA. And when it comes down to the master hormones in our body,
our cortisol, insulin, and my absolute favorite hormone that I&#39;m absolutely in love love love
with, the hormone of love, bonding and connection, and that&#39;s oxytocin. Not to be confused
with oxycodone.
Rebekah Kelley: [Laughs] Very different. So the process of our brain using glucose for fuel is a
very estrogen dominant process. And as estrogen decreases as we age, obviously this is not
ideal. I know you talk in your book about how ketones are better served as fuel here. Could you
talk about that?

Anna Cabeca: Yes, it&#39;s so important to understand this. Because when I was 48, turning 48,
going through my second menopause, I had the weight gain without doing anything different.
That&#39;s so frustrating. And until I went through it myself, I didn&#39;t really one hundred percent
believe my patients when they would tell me that. A very humbling experience. But the brain
fog, the memory loss, the irritability, the monster within, as some patients described it, I
experienced that too, that kind of erupts her ugly head – that was not me. And the weight gain
was most troublesome. This is what took me on this journey and what I&#39;ve written about now
for years. But what was really important to understand, what I learned through this process and
developing the plan I call Keto-Green, was that for our brain to use glucose for fuel, it&#39;s
hormone dependent. And for now, we know that it&#39;s estrogen, but I really believe, Rebekah,
that progesterone is a game changer and this is the key master hormone in this. But for now we
say, gluconeogenesis in the brain we know is estrogen dependent. And as we lose estrogen, as
we age, the brain may be suffocating a little bit and is struggling and is challenged, because that
process is estrogen dependent. But ketone use in the brain is not. We completely bypass that
hormone component and that&#39;s when our brain lights up, our brain fog lifts, our memory gets
better, and if we add the key part that I call the green or the alkalinizing part, add that and
we&#39;re back at home in our body. And our hormones, you are going through this hormone
fluctuation, it&#39;s not just a “good idea” to go Keto-Green, it&#39;s in my opinion, mandatory. So I&#39;ll
never say direct keto, there&#39;s dirty keto out there, and we don&#39;t want dirty keto.
Rebekah Kelley: So then could the lack of estrogen as we age be the reason women are two
times as likely to get Alzheimer&#39;s? Is that kind of hand-in-hand?
Anna Cabeca: I think it&#39;s a big process. Cause there&#39;s a few things that are happening with this
perimenopause. You lose that progesterone, which is neuroprotective, and it&#39;s not getting
replaced most of the time, for the long haul. And I really believe progesterone is one of those
key hormones. Supporting our natural body&#39;s production of progesterone.
But also, bioidentical progesterone replacement, especially as we&#39;re older, transdermally, safely
– we don&#39;t have to take a pill – safely, to be protective. And I think that we&#39;re going to see some
more research on that. We know progesterone has effects on the brain. So this loss of estrogen,
the increase in insulin and increase in cortisol as we age are two other really key factors, as
well.
So I think between those four top [things]… we have some disadvantages and that&#39;s why
becoming more insulin sensitive, managing cortisol, increasing oxytocin – that cortisol&#39;s an
acidifying hormone, it&#39;s a caustic hormone, it breaks us down – and becoming more on the
alkaline side, hence the greens and the alkalinizers. I know from our community that have been
doing Keto-Green for a few years now, tens of thousands of them, their memory is better than
ever, and they feel at home in their body. And that&#39;s what we&#39;re going for here.
Rebekah Kelley: So you put a twist on your approach of creating the Keto-Green way and
bringing alkalinity into the picture. I don&#39;t know whether one would say controversy, but you

know, with the blood pH not changing, right? There&#39;s some question around that. So can you
just kind of explain a little bit?
Anna Cabeca: Yeah. And I love this because you&#39;ve heard really big out there, oh, that&#39;s an
alkaline myth. Well, that right there is a myth. Because we know, I know as a surgeon and a
physician, that if a patient comes into my emergency room or comes into my clinic crashing, I&#39;m
going to draw an arterial blood gas. That&#39;s the first thing we do in the ER, we draw an arterial
blood gas, and we want to assess the pH of the blood. How acidic is this person? What&#39;s going
on with this person? The pH we&#39;re going to manage... and that&#39;s your arterial blood gas, right?
Not venous, not drawn blood out, but that&#39;s the arterial blood gas. And that is, oxygenation is
key for alkalinization of the blood. Maintaining a slightly alkaline pH, 7.4 approximately.
So we maintain this a little bit higher, a little bit lower, and we are really, really sick. And that&#39;s
why we draw this pH. And often when we give bicarb to that crashing person, who&#39;s in an
acidotic state, for whatever reason it could be. It could be from cancer, could be from
malnutrition, it could be from alcoholism, it could be, whatever it may be. So that&#39;s critical, that
pH. Our body will rob Peter to pay Paul, to maintain that blood pH.
But what are the stages until we get there? Our cells have different pH. Skin, slightly acidic.
Why? Because we need to defend, it&#39;s our first layer of defense. The vagina, acidic. I mean, it
takes millions of sperm to get past that acidic environment. Right? Millions over the centuries
have been evolved because, it&#39;s like, got survival of the fittest. Why? Cause they&#39;ve got to first
go through an acidic vagina. It&#39;s protective, meant to protect us against bacteria. And man, I
may get into this because, all these vaginal, like different vaginal washes and soaps and things
that are destroying our vaginal pH, you&#39;re destroying your primary line of duty. And that is so
key. Oral health is key. Vaginal health is key, but look, it knows what it&#39;s doing. Mostly leave it
alone. And so there&#39;s that piece.
And then the bladder, the bladder is a barometer. Just like we take our temperature, I believe
measuring your urinary pH is like that, is a barometer for your overall health. When we are
stressed, unhealthy, our urine pH is acidic. When we are grounded, when we go for a hike with
friends in the woods, and are hydrated well, we are alkaline. When we are eating well, we&#39;re
more alkaline. And research, scientific studies, many scientific studies have shown that a more
alkaline urine, pH greater than seven, everyone can test it, it costs pennies to go to any grocery
store and get some pH paper, or I have pH and ketone paper, but you just test it for pennies
and check and see what it is. And it will change throughout the day. If you&#39;ve had stressful
exercise, you&#39;ll be more acidic. That&#39;s okay. We want to tear down and build up tissue. But
you&#39;ve had a great night of lovemaking, you should be more alkaline in the morning. Right? And
if you&#39;re eating well, the ketogenic diet is acidic until you add that alkaline component, which is
key for women. That just makes all the difference in the world. You balance both. And what we
know and what many women in my communities will say, combine that alkalinity with the
ketosis. And it is lights on, feel amazing, feel at home in your body, and you&#39;re super charged.
And I love hearing that.

A little bit about Dr. Anna Cabeca. She is a triple board certified and fellow of gynecology and
obstetrics, integrative medicine, and anti-aging and regenerative medicine. Nationally known as
&quot;the girlfriend doctor,&quot; Dr. Anna is a passionate health advocate for women, helping them to
truly thrive in body, mind and spirit. She is the author of two highly acclaimed books, created
several popular virtual transformation programs, created several top-selling health products,
and is a sought-after lecturer throughout the world. And we&#39;re so lucky to have her here.
Thank you so much, Dr. Anna, for being with us.
Anna Cabeca: Thank you, Rebekah, for having me.
Rebekah Kelley: So I want to talk about how women are, I don&#39;t know about conditioned, but
definitely believe that perimenopause and menopause are stages of life definitely to be fear,
right? The uncontrollable hot flashes, the erratic emotions, the weight gain all come to mind,
and you&#39;re very gifted in how to help women move through these stages. And can you just kind
of talk about ways that we can feel empowered rather than doomed in this stage of our life?
Anna Cabeca: Yeah, and I really do think that it is a time to recognize our own power, our
feminine power, and to tap into that because at no other time in our life are we more liberated
to really express it. And that&#39;s what I want people listening to know. And say we&#39;ve been in this
cocoon, right? We&#39;ve been getting all this growth and information. Time to emerge from the
cocoon as a butterfly. I would say, do you want to come out as the butterfly or the moth?
[Laughs} So we have to do our work, right? So we can be fully colorful and beautiful and all that.
And so for me, it&#39;s about breezing through menopause into our second spring of our life.
There&#39;s no martyrdom for suffering. There&#39;s no reason that we have to suffer through this
change. And what we&#39;re experiencing today isn&#39;t what our mothers experienced before. So it&#39;s
not your mother&#39;s menopause. It&#39;s our own individual fingerprint to this time, this environment,
the consequences of past experiences, et cetera, in our life, and how we show up into the
second spring of our life. And I think it is a really beautiful, empowering time of life.
Rebekah Kelley: Well, thank you so much. I love how you look at it. So obviously one of the
challenges that we do experience, though, is hormones are changing, right? And they definitely
do influence how we feel and what we&#39;re experiencing. And so of course, one of the ways that

we can treat them is with bioidentical hormones. So can you talk about, basically, the
downsides of our typical HRT hormones?
Anna Cabeca: Yeah. And when it comes to looking at bioidentical hormones and again, this
whole transition, menopause is as mandatory and natural as puberty is. Suffering is optional,
right? Suffering is optional. There&#39;s so much we can do about it. This is where bioidentical
hormones really come in. And they can come in at different degrees. But, we don&#39;t want to
completely suppress this transition. We want it to happen, but we want to support it. Because
we&#39;re not living in nature, right? So this is where we can benefit from the addition,
supplemental addition of hormones. And bioidentical versus synthetic hormones is a big,
controversial topic, but without a doubt, the synthetic hormones have negative side effects
that, if we have a better option, why are we choosing the synthetic?
So we know from the Women&#39;s Health Initiative study, and the HERS [Heart and
Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study] trial – I actually did an arm of the HERS trial, I&#39;ve been a
researcher since before I went to medical school – and so looking at the cardiovascular
consequences, looking at the breast cancer issues, were associated with synthetic progestin,
predominantly. Synthetic progestin, it doesn&#39;t act like our bioidentical progesterone. And this is
where people get scared because the literature, even the scientific literature has confused the
terms of progestin to progesterone. Progesterone is our bioidentical progesterone. And you
want to be clear. There&#39;s nothing that works better than our bioidentical progesterone. And
progestins cause edema, can cause brain fog, can cause negative cardiovascular effects,
adverse effects on our lipid profile. And that&#39;s a choice.
And the other thing with estrogens, because we know about Premarin, which, a long time ago, I
actually worked for Wyeth Ayerst, the maker of Premarin. I was in their drug metabolism
department before med school. And so, Premarin is a combination of estrogens derived from
pregnant mares&#39; urine. And so it&#39;s like a bucket of estrogens. And one of the myths that came,
that you can&#39;t measure hormones – I mean, we can&#39;t measure them exactly. But one of the
myths was because you can&#39;t measure progestins and these complex estrogens in your blood,
you know, because there were 30 different estrogens in Premarin. So you really can&#39;t do a
blood test for that. So, how interesting, right? But oral estrogens can cause increase in blood
clots, coagulopathies, an increase in inflammatory markers, according to some excellent studies
that have been published years ago, a decade ago. So that should show us.
So we want to switch to what&#39;s bioidentical, natural, and use the transport mechanism, that&#39;s
the safest way possible. So is it oral, or is it transdermal, or is it vaginal, or is it injections, or is it
pellets? I mean, there&#39;s different ways we can administer hormones.
Rebekah Kelley: So how are the bioidentical hormones then different than that, and why would
we choose that? How does that help?

Anna Cabeca: So the advantage to using bioidentical hormones and estrogen specifically – and
there are bioidentical prescription estrogens, like in many of the patches or vaginal
prescriptions that we can get – but the difference is that, one difference is in the bioidentical
hormones, we are looking at, typically we look at an estradiol and estriol combination and the
three predominant estrogens in our body. Are you wanting E2 or E3? E2 is most common.
Estradiol is the most common one that we know about and that we&#39;ve studied. The most
predominant one in our body, certainly at this stage in our reproductive stage of our lives. So
that&#39;s estradiol.
And orally, the same thing with oral bioidentical hormones. The oral bioidentical hormones are
going to do the same thing as other estrogens. And that&#39;s going to increase inflammatory
markers, increase the risk of blood clots, and that&#39;s why young people on birth control pills can
get blood clots. So we&#39;re going to avoid that as much as possible when we switched to
transdermal or another route. And the bioidentical progesterone is identical to our body&#39;s own
natural progesterone. It&#39;s identical in structure, in chemical structure. So the same thing for
using it orally or transdermally, that our body is recognizing it as something familiar. And we
can test, we can do blood tests, salivary tests, urine tests that look at what happens when we
absorb these chemicals into our body.
Rebekah Kelley: So, how would someone look at this and determine whether or not they need
some additional support? What are some flags to someone that they might need some
bioidentical hormones?
Anna Cabeca: So there&#39;s a couple of things. First, I always say, when a patient comes into my
office and she&#39;s complaining of hot flashes, mood swings, weight gain, brain fog, memory loss,
loss of sex drive, right? There&#39;s a lot going on here. The first thing I would do is typically, I&#39;ll run
labs. And I have them do a questionnaire in the office, and I can see all the things that are going
on. It’s the same questionnaire that&#39;s in my book, The Hormone Fix. I have a couple in there.
I&#39;ve used it since the start of my practice. And that gives you a good idea. You&#39;re able to, like, oh
my God, I didn&#39;t realize I had all these symptoms. Sometimes it&#39;s eye-opening for the individual
when you start doing that, right? You&#39;re like, oh my gosh, I am falling apart. What&#39;s going on?
Doctor, help me.
I get it, I get it. And so I send off the blood test to the lab and I&#39;ll put them on a detox program,
like my like Keto-Green detox. That&#39;s in my book, The Hormone Fix. And I may supplement with
additional adaptogenic support, especially for under stress – I don&#39;t want you to go without it –
and often, depending on those results and if you&#39;re having menopausal symptoms, I&#39;ll put you
on some progesterone cream right away, because it&#39;s safe, I want you to get a good night&#39;s
sleep. Bioidentical progesterone helps you get a good night&#39;s sleep, and that can just be game
changing. And by the time that patient comes in within 4 to 6 weeks for her lab results, she&#39;s
already feeling 90% better. That&#39;s the key. She&#39;s empowered. She feels better. She&#39;s made a few
dietary lifestyle changes. She&#39;s getting a better night&#39;s sleep. She&#39;s had some adaptogenic
support and she&#39;s just feeling so much better.

And patients will often tell me, I didn&#39;t realize how bad I was feeling until I started feeling good
again. And I&#39;m telling you, whether we have a uterus or not, bioidentical progesterone is
essential, menopause and beyond. We&#39;re not going to make it any other way. We need it for
our brain, to protect our breasts, our bones. No question about it.

known as &quot;the girlfriend doctor,&quot; Dr. Anna is a passionate health advocate for women

We&#39;re so lucky to have her.
Thank you so much, Dr. Anna, for being here.
Anna Cabeca: Thank you for having me. It&#39;s a privilege.
Rebekah Kelley: So very excited to talk about this subject. And I want to bring up the fact
that hormones are very sensitive to stress and certainly the ages between 35 and 60 can be
very stressful for most women. Right? We&#39;re juggling a lot of things. We&#39;re raising kids. We
have careers, we&#39;re taking care of aging parents. Can you talk about how that could
influence and put stress on our adrenals, our hormones, and create inflammation in our
body, and create kind of a perfect storm, right?
Anna Cabeca: Yeah, I think the perfect storm is us going through perimenopause and
menopause and having teenage daughters at home, going through puberty. [Laughs]That&#39;s
the perfect storm. It&#39;s a cruel joke. It really shouldn&#39;t occur that way, but it has, and it is for
me. So... it&#39;s all good. It&#39;s all good.
And that&#39;s the thing. We have our beautiful reproductive hormones. We&#39;ve got
progesterone as this mother hormone – pro-gestational, pro-life hormone. It&#39;s so important
for so many things, right? It&#39;s important for our mind. We know progesterone is a
neuropeptide. It really works on the brain, on memory, and it&#39;s an anti-inflammatory and a
diuretic. That&#39;s why it&#39;s been studied in traumatic brain injury in both men and women. And
so it&#39;s a beautiful hormone.
As our hormones are changing, that one thing we need to understand, that progesterone is
the precursor hormone to make cortisol. So now, add some stress in there and we are just,
we have to make this life-saving hormone cortisol in sacrifice to every other downstream
hormone, which way down there is DHEA, estrogen and testosterone.

So, we&#39;re using up our progesterone to make cortisol, to a great degree, then our DHEA and
our estrogen and testosterone plummet and this creates fatigue, muscle wasting, rapid
aging – I mean, look at every president in the White House over, whenever, and from
beginning to end, they really age very rapidly. And so that is cortisol. That is stress. And we
know that, now during this time of pandemic, the amount of stress we&#39;re under. And also
the increase in hormone problems that we&#39;re seeing now, as well as the feelings of
disconnect. Because when cortisol is high, the hormone of love, bonding and connection is
low and creates this disconnect, creates this imbalance, this feeling of, I call it the physiology
of divorce, if we&#39;re not careful.
Rebekah Kelley: So, if we look at that perfect storm then, what&#39;s happening with our
hormones, obviously we&#39;re talking about weight gain. So it&#39;s very easy to not feel very sexy
as a woman, right? We&#39;re not used to carrying this extra weight. We can talk about fatigue,
discomfort, even lack of sexual desire, right? Because our hormones are shifting down. Are
we looking at a sexless future, a sexless marriage moving forward? I mean, that&#39;s just too
horrible to contemplate. And if so, what do we do about it, if that&#39;s how we feel?
Anna Cabeca: Yeah. Well, and I think that it speaks to the unspoken-ness of this issue
because I think the most read article in the New York Times was the article on the sexless
marriage. And it just means a lot of people are suffering in silence. And I think, from working
with tens of thousands of women now in my career as a gynecologist and obstetrician and
expert in sexual health, one of the things that I&#39;ve realized is that – there&#39;s so many things,
oh my God, I know we don&#39;t have a lot of time, but... One thing is that a primary sexual
response is masculine, a secondary sexual response is feminine. Because as so many
patients would say, you know, Dr. Anna, I just have no sex drive. I don&#39;t initiate sex
anymore. What&#39;s wrong with me? And, you know, to be honest, nothing, as long as she says,
but once we get started – and I&#39;ve heard this enough times to be like, look, I got to
investigate this – but once we get started I&#39;m okay, then I&#39;m turned on. That&#39;s secondary
response and that&#39;s normal. That&#39;s physiologic. What we want to build in is some natural
primary libido, some primary drive too, on demand.
I had patients that came into my office, a couple, a man and woman, she&#39;d been my patient
for a while, and they had come in to me and he said, you know, Dr. Anna, we have a great
sex life, but she never wants to initiate sex, and I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on. And I asked
her, she says yeah, I have great orgasms, I just never feel like initiating. So I turned to him
and I say, well, what do you do after sex? And he goes, I roll over and go to sleep. I&#39;m like,
well, that&#39;s a natural response, but it&#39;s not going to get her wanting more sex. Because while
the climax is good, the intimacy and connection, while our oxytocin level – that anti-aging
hormone oxytocin, my favorite hormone oxytocin – while that&#39;s high, we need that bonding,
that connection, that validation, that feeling valued. We need that time. So give us 2
minutes and it&#39;s good. So I sent him homework. I said, don&#39;t fall asleep for 2 minutes, at
least, and just connect, just love on each other. Outside of physical intimacy, this is the time
to connect. And by the time they came back in, 2 months later, she goes, I&#39;ve already
introduced sex a handful of times, and it&#39;s just so much better. And the other part she said –
and we&#39;ve talked about things we haven&#39;t discussed in our 15-year marriage. And so I think

that&#39;s the value of intimacy and connection, and some of the things that come in with
disconnection.
The second biggest thing that comes into disconnect is vaginal dryness and discomfort. As
we age, just like we&#39;re going to get wrinkles here and we&#39;re Botoxing them out and filling
them out and whatever, lasering them off, I don&#39;t know – but what&#39;s happening down there
is even more important. That&#39;s going to affect your quality of life. And so clitoris-anus, that&#39;s
primary real estate. And we have to take care of that. There are 8,000 nerve endings in the
clitoris and that&#39;s going to atrophy and shrivel up if we let it. But we don&#39;t have to. And the
same thing with vaginal dryness, if you hurt every time you have sex, why would you want
to? And because mirror neurons, we have mirror neurons with our partner and he will feel
what we&#39;re feeling. He will know what we&#39;re experiencing, whether we voice it or not, it&#39;s
subconscious, but it happens.
So the point I want to make is that women are responsible for their own pleasure. We&#39;re
designed for pleasure. So allow it be present, achieve your benefit from it. Because I&#39;ve
heard so many women say, it hurts, I have discomfort, I don&#39;t climax, I&#39;m powering through
for the sake of my marriage. Well, that&#39;s not going to last you.
Rebekah Kelley: So for recognizing that part of life and owning our connection, owning our
wellness, owning our sexual intimate relationship, what are some of the steps that we can
take to do that? I know that you offer some of that in your book, and I am going to show
your cream, for those who can see it [holds up tube of cream]. Maybe you can talk about it.
Cause I know sometimes you do need some additional support. Right? And sometimes the
things that are out on the market, they actually create more problems, right? Because they
don&#39;t actually work well with, downstairs, so to speak, and can actually create urinary issues
and other incontinent issues. And so I know you created something that&#39;s really helpful. I&#39;m
sure you&#39;ve got some other tips that maybe we might be able to use.
Anna Cabeca: Yeah, so I created Julva for myself and my patients because it is a natural
topical cosmetic cream for the vulva. Use it clitoris to anus. You can put some on toilet
paper and wipe with it, do it every day. You can put it on, massage, massage it in and
massage it in yourself, clitoris to anus, around the vulva, the vagina. And use it as part of
sexual play, as well. So the reason I created it with the ingredients I created it with, including
DHEA and plant stem cells from the Alpine rose and some emollient oils, that it is designed
to help be reparative and help reduce the changes that are happening as we age. And it
works amazing. And it feels so good to use it because there&#39;s no chemicals in there. It&#39;s clean
and it works. We have thousands of testimonials on our website now. It&#39;s been around since
2016, brought it to market, but I&#39;d been compounding formulas since &#39;99 with my patients.
So that&#39;s one thing. The second thing is definitely my book, The Hormone Fix. It&#39;s a great
resource for our listeners because I have a vaginal health chapter in there. And again, it
takes more than hormones to fix our hormones. So, understanding all the things that can
disrupt our hormones. And when it comes to vaginal health, gut health is crucially
important. And we need those healthy fats. We need to get rid of sugar, too, so we want to

have sex more often. Believe me, there&#39;s a whole nother discussion there. But that&#39;s a really
big thing.
And the third thing that I offer is I have a program called sexual CPR, a fun, holistic
integrative approach to address the many reasons why we have &quot;lost our sexy.&quot; And it&#39;s
great for men and women to take that course together.

Anna Cabeca: It&#39;s a pleasure. Thanks for having me.
Rebekah Kelley: So we&#39;re talking about hot flashes, right? So women are certainly... We fear
this stage of life, right? Where we have hot flashes, erratic emotions, weight gain, the list of
things goes on. Brain fog. How do you help women move through these stages and feel
empowered rather than doomed?
Anna Cabeca: Well, I think this is a really important thing to discuss because for so many
people, they&#39;ve been told, oh, it&#39;ll go away on its own. And I have known people now that have
come to me and have had suffering with hot flashes for over 20 years. So, it is not something
you have to experience. There are ways that we can fix it, for sure.
Rebekah Kelley: Setting the tone about, how can you help us feel empowered rather than
doomed? Cause I know in your book, when I read it, I felt so empowered. You just set the tone
for what that is.
Anna Cabeca: I think it&#39;s so important that we are empowered ourselves, naturally, and realize
how much power we have. And that&#39;s one thing I want people to take back. Stop giving your
power away to marketing, to pharma, to procedures. Take it back. Take it back on your own so
that we can breeze through menopause into the second spring of our life, where we can fully
experience and express our feminine empowerment.
Rebekah Kelley: So, menopause affects everyone differently. And we&#39;re basically here to talk
about hot flashes, right? So what do you think triggers hot flashes?

Anna Cabeca: So, one of the primary triggers that we don&#39;t talk about – and actually until I
went through my own experience with my second menopause, I didn&#39;t realize – it&#39;s insulin
resistance. Insulin resistance is a key reason women will have hot flashes for like 20 years. And
certainly estrogen plays a role. The fact that we live in climate-controlled life, that plays a role.
But insulin resistance is key because in 2 weeks of doing my Keto-Green™ [diet] , 80-90% of
women say their hot flashes have completely resolved.
And I think that&#39;s what&#39;s really, again, empowering when we make these changes, and WE did
it, right? We didn&#39;t put on an estrogen patch. Although I&#39;m fine with that, right? But WE did
that. And the changes in our lifestyle and our behavior makes a huge difference on our
physiology. That&#39;s powerful.
Rebekah Kelley: So how can we eliminate or minimize or even prevent them, naturally and
organically, then?
Anna Cabeca: First it&#39;s really identify when you&#39;re getting them. How are they affecting you? Is
it just at night or is it all throughout the day? I mean, for some women it&#39;s every 20 minutes. For
others, they just wake up in the middle of the night, soaking wet with hot flashes or night
sweat. And there&#39;s a couple of reasons there. It can be a cortisol surge in the middle of the
night that&#39;s waking you up and creating that hot flash because of... also, it relates to blood
sugar stability. So the first thing that we can all do to eliminate or reduce our risk of hot flashes,
as well as Alzheimer&#39;s, as well as cardiovascular disease, as well as metabolic syndrome, and to
help us lose weight, it&#39;s to manage glucose stability. So that means eliminate the majority of the
carbohydrates that we&#39;re eating from our diet and get into what I call the Keto-Green state,
getting into ketosis in a healthy, clean way, because we know there can be keto dirty, but we
want Keto-Green, which is keto clean. And that&#39;s a good, healthy way. But with that is
intermittent fasting and no more snacking. And at this time in our lives, two or three meals a
day is fine. It&#39;s fine. And snacking is going to increase hot flashes, it&#39;s going to increase a
metabolic stall, and it&#39;s going to put on weight – and we don&#39;t want any of that. There&#39;s no
reason for it.
Rebekah Kelley: So...
Anna Cabeca: And then hormones.
Rebekah Kelley: Okay, go ahead and talk about that.
Anna Cabeca: And then hormones. So we know certainly estrogen can be a huge benefit for hot
flashes, but we never want to forget progesterone because progesterone has so many benefits
for our brain and body overall. So we look at that. And bio-identical – when we choose
hormones, we want to choose bio-identical hormones.

The second thing is, because the adrenal glands have such a huge influence on our body, on our
metabolism, on our hormone health in general, and certainly affect our hot flashes, we want to
use, often, adaptogens that can help us. So supplementing with adaptogens.
But a lifestyle factor that makes a key difference is empowering the alkalinizing behaviors. Like
anything that increases oxytocin, like laughing, having fun, hiking, getting into nature, getting a
good night&#39;s sleep, exercising, moving your body in a way you love to move it, and of course
intimacy – all of those things are going to increase oxytocin, lower cortisol, and help support
you.
So between managing insulin and cortisol and optimizing oxytocin, you&#39;re going to eliminate
hot flashes, with rare exceptions.
Rebekah Kelley: So I kind of accidentally fell in. I didn&#39;t have the benefit of your book. And I fell
into actually discovering insulin resistance, and whenever I was able to calm down my body and
my sugar spikes, I actually found myself no longer having hot flashes. Right? So it took me a
little while. I had to give up alcohol, because that was definitely a factor. I don&#39;t know. You
didn&#39;t have to do... you don&#39;t think you have to do that? No?
Anna Cabeca: [Shaking head no.] No. Maybe for other reasons, but not for hot flashes, yet.
Rebekah Kelley: Really? Okay.
Anna Cabeca: But definitely alcohol is a trigger. Alcohol, spicy food, intense heat. All of those
things can be, for sure.
Rebekah Kelley: And you also talked about moving from temperature to temperature, 70
[degrees at home] to 70 [degrees in the car] to 70 [degrees in the office]. Can you talk about
temperature?
Anna Cabeca: Yeah. Metabolic, we talk about metabolic flexibility. Just like we shouldn&#39;t do the
same exercise every day, we shouldn&#39;t eat the same chicken salad every day. Let me tell you,
I&#39;ve heard so many people eat chicken salad every day and they think they&#39;re healthy. Believe
me, stop it. Stop. Okay, chicken salad&#39;s healthy once every 4 or 5 days, but not every day. Okay.
Anyway, so metabolic flexibility is really important. We&#39;re designed to adapt to nature, to be in
cold, to be in heat, to be in a variety of temperatures, depending on where our genetics are
from, right? And so exposing yourself to differing degrees of temperatures and heat is really
important. That&#39;s where cold plunges have come into benefit. Infrared sauna. Another reason
that these are part of our longevity. Biohacks that we incorporate into our lifestyle, when we
want to biohack, because there are benefits. I prefer infrared sauna over an ice cold plunge any
day, but, yeah, so I&#39;ll do that once in a while.

biggest go-to&#39;s is creatine.
David Stouder: Most men run into prostate problems, from minor to serious, in
their lifetime. Perhaps I might ask, what are some of the key bad habits that we
men do that lead us to that place?
Dr. Geo Espinosa: I would say that there is a genetic component; some men are
just more predisposed to urinary problems that derive from prostate issues. I
think for 70, 80% of us, it&#39;s just lifestyle. What are those key lifestyle things?
Excess alcohol consumption. Everybody can have a drink here and there, no
problem. Excess alcohol consumption, however, can start causing inflammation,
and inflammation around the prostate. One of the key things that happens with
the prostate is inflammation. So it starts growing. Not only does it grow, but it
starts squeezing the tube, the urethra, that brings out the urine. Then that causes
urinary problems.
Another thing I hear is, &quot; Dr. Geo, what is the number one thing that men need to
focus on to get better?&quot; Well, there&#39;s no number one thing. &quot;No, no, no.&quot; They get
a gun to my head; &quot;What&#39;s the number one thing??? Give me the one thing I
don&#39;t know.&quot; All right. You have to have healthy smooth muscles.
What does that mean? We all have three types of muscles in our bodies. We have
skeletal muscles, that&#39;s the muscle to move our bones. We have cardiac muscles
around our heart. And we have smooth muscle. Those are the muscles that the
arteries use that expand and dilate. Those are the muscles of the bladder. Those
are the muscles that include the prostate. People don&#39;t know that. They call the
prostate a gland. It is glandular, but 30% of the prostate is smooth muscle. So we
need to do more things for the smooth muscles, so that we live longer and
happier and better.
So treating smooth muscle, how do we do that? We use things like magnesium,
things that relax these smooth muscles. Magnesium is excellent. Citrate,
threonate, malate, glycinate, they&#39;re all good, and they all have different purposes.
But magnesium is good.
I like certain botanicals to calm down the smooth muscles, because the smooth
muscles tend to become hyperactive as we age. Hyperactive smooth muscles
affect the bladder, going like this uncontrolled, and you have to urinate more.
And the prostate and arteries are going uncontrolled, and you have to urinate
more. So botanicals like lemon balm and scutellaria, these are sort of an anxiolytic
type of nervines, a type of botanicals. That is a key takeaway here.
David Stouder: That&#39;s excellent. I want to thank you for being with us, Dr. Geo; I
encourage everyone to go to your website. DrGeo.com. It&#39;s a great website. I was

I am your host, Rebekah Kelley. Before I introduce our guest, I want to remind
you to subscribe, to get all of our variety of casts – audio, video and
transcription – at HumanizedHealth.com. I&#39;d also like to thank our lead
sponsor, Village Green Apothecary at MyVillageGreen.com .
Our guest today is Dr. Michael Greger, a founding member and fellow of the
American College of Lifestyle Medicine. Dr. Greger is a physician, New York
Times bestselling author, and internationally recognized speaker on nutrition.
He has videos on more than 2,000 health topics, freely available at
NutritionFacts.org, with new videos and articles uploaded almost every day.
Dr. Greger has lectured at the Conference on World Affairs, testified before
Congress and was invited as an expert witness in the defense of Oprah
Winfrey in the infamous meat defamation trial. He is a graduate of Cornell
University’s School of Agriculture and Tufts university, School of Medicine.
Three of his recent books, How Not to Die, How Not to Die Cookbook, and
How Not to Die At All, became instant New York Times bestsellers. His latest
book, How to Survive a Pandemic, was just released in May. All proceeds he
receives from the sales of his book go to charity.
Thanks for being on the show, Dr. Greger. When I read your book, I was
surprised by the pandemics you describe and their causes. You list quite a few
that are ongoing. Do you mind walking us through that?
Dr. Michael Greger: The first half of my professional career was infectious
disease. The reason I became so interested is that I did postgraduate medical
work on an AIDS ward. Growing up there was no such thing as HIV. So where
did this disease come from in the first place? That question really started me
down this journey.
All of our major infectious diseases, historically, have come from animals. For
example, tuberculosis is thought to have been acquired from the domestication of
goats; measles, also from goats or sheep. Smallpox seems to have been a result of
camel domestication. We domesticated pigs and got whooping cough,
domesticated chickens and got typhoid fever, and domesticated ducks and got
influenza. Leprosy came from water buffalo, the common cold from horses. I mean,
how often did humanity have the opportunity to be sneezed on in the face by
horses before we broke and bridled them? Until then, the common cold was
presumably only common to horses.

That was 10,000 years ago. What has happened over the last few decades?
We now have hundreds of new pathogens, emerging at a rate
unprecedented in human history. And they are emerging from the same
place, because we changed the way we interact with the animal kingdom.
For example, the AIDS virus was blamed on the butchering of primates and
the bushmeat trade in Africa; mad cow disease was because we turned
natural herbivores into carnivores and cannibals. SARS and COVID-19 have
been traced back to the exotic wild animal trade.
And our last pandemic, swine flu in 2009, was not from some backwater wet
market in Asia, it was largely made in the United States on pig farms.
Thankfully, swine flu only killed about a half million people. The next time we
might not be so lucky.
Rebekah Kelley: Before reading your book, I wasn&#39;t aware about infection
from animals. When COVID-19 came out, where did it come from? You
mentioned bats and scaly anteaters. Low and behold, here we have more
animal to human infection happening.
Dr. Michael Greger: As devastating as COVID-19 is, it may just be kind of a
dress rehearsal for an even greater threat waiting in the wings of chickens.
According to the CDC, the leading candidate for the next pandemic is a bird
flu virus known as H7N9, which is a hundred times deadlier than COVID-19.
Instead of 1 in 250 cases dying, 40% of the people that have been affected by
this chicken flu virus have died. The last time a bird flu virus jumped directly
to human beings and triggered a pandemic, it triggered the deadliest plague
in history, the 1918 pandemic. It killed 50 million people; and that one had a 2%
death rate. What if we had a pandemic infecting billions of people where it
was more like 40%?
The good news is that there&#39;s something we can do about it. Just like
eliminating the exotic, wild animal trade and live animal markets may go a
long way towards preventing the next coronavirus pandemic, reforming the
way we raise animals for food, domesticated animals, may help forestall the
next killer flu.
Rebekah Kelley: Where are the pandemics coming from?

Dr. Michael Greger: Well, the greatest concern for the next pandemic is
coming from the way we raise domesticated animals. When we overcrowd
thousands of animals in these cramped, filthy, football field-sized sheds, beak
to beak or snout to snout on top of their own waste, it&#39;s just a breeding
ground for disease. The sheer number of animals, the overcrowding, the
stress, which is crippling their immune system, the ammonia from the
decomposing waste, which is burning their lungs, the lack of fresh air, the
lack of sunlight, put all these factors together and what you have is a perfect
storm environment for the emergence and spread of super strains of
influenza. These so-called factory farms are a public health menace. The
bottom line is that it&#39;s not worth risking the lives of millions of people for the
sake of cheaper chicken.
Rebekah Kelley: I know you said this could be a dress rehearsal. Hopefully we
have learned lessons. What steps can we take to be the best prepared, both
as individuals and also as a community?
Dr. Michael Greger: Look, we may be one bushmeat meal away from the next
HIV, one pangolin plate (the scaly anteaters) from the next killer coronavirus,
and one factory farm away from the next deadly flu. But along with human
culpability comes hope, right? If changes in human behavior can cause new
plagues, then changes in human behavior may prevent them in the future.
So what does that mean? That means moving away from animal sources of
protein. We&#39;ve already had tremendous movement in this sphere. Major dairy
corporations are going out of business because of a new constellation of
consumer choices, and the same thing is happening in the meat aisle.
Now we have major meat producers like Tyson, Purdue and Smithfield, all
coming out with plant-based lines of meat products. They are offering
consumers choices. And, wait a second; they taste as good, have the same
mouth feel and texture, are healthier for you personally, healthy for the earth
in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, and healthier in terms of having zero
pandemic risk. This is the kind of change that we&#39;re seeing coming from
some of the biggest meat corporations in the world. It&#39;s really the kind of
writing on the wall, which will help us get out of this precarious situation.
Rebekah Kelley: You mentioned in your book the importance of being
kinder to animals. You talked about pig factory farms. The animals don&#39;t even
have straw; their bodies are right up against cold slabs of concrete. As human

beings, we know how important it is to be in an environment that is
conducive and kind to our immune system. If we&#39;re doing this to our animals,
there&#39;s no way that they&#39;re going to be strong and healthy in the event that
they are animals that we are going to be eating.
Dr. Michael Greger: Right. And there is science to back this up. We need to
give these animals some more breathing room. They&#39;re the ones who could
use a little social distancing at this point! Indeed, the study you cited showed
that measures as simple as providing straw bedding, so that pigs don&#39;t have
the immuno-suppressive stress of laying on bare concrete their whole lives,
significantly reduces swine flu transmission rates. So we should follow the
advice of the Pew Commission on Industrial Animal Production or the
American Public Health Association, the longest running and oldest
association of nutrition and public health professionals in the world, which
has called for a moratorium on factory farms. No more factory farms.
We don&#39;t tend to shore up the levees until after disaster strikes, but in this
case we have to. Hopefully this is the kind of trial run we needed, the fire drill
to wake us out of our complacency, or it could be much, much worse.
Hopefully we&#39;ll start looking around once we reach our head above the sand
with this current pandemic and realize we really need to find out ways for
primary prevention. We must not just meet the impact of the pandemic, but
prevent the emergence of the next pandemic virus in the first place.
Rebekah Kelley: What would you recommend for improving our immunity,
like supplements or foods? In your book, How Not to Die (I absolutely love it,
and have my copy right here), you&#39;re great about informing, educating and
helping us understand what we need to do to make sure our system is
running the best it can. What should we do in relation to the pandemic?
Dr. Michael Greger: Consider the underlying risk factors for COVID-19 severity
and death. They are: obesity, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and heart
disease, all of which can be prevented, arrested, and in some cases, even
reversed with a healthy enough diet centered around whole plant foods.
And you don&#39;t even have to be obese; just having a BMI of 28, can make you
six times more likely to suffer a severe COVID-19 case. The average BMI in the
United States is 29. So even being skinnier than the average American can
leave you so much excess body fat that it can significantly increase your risk
of hospitalization and death.

That&#39;s why this is the time to take better care of ourselves. Now we&#39;re not
passing the donut shop on the way to work, and there aren&#39;t bowls of candy
on everyone&#39;s desk or whatever your work situation is. Most of us have more
control over our food environment now. So this is the time to clean out the
pantry. This is the time to start that exercise program or that meditation
program, or to get into a better sleep rituals. This is the time to take better
care of ourselves because it won&#39;t only protect you right now against the
current infectious disease threat, but down the road for chronic lifestyle
diseases in the future.
Rebekah Kelley: Well, you&#39;re giving us a perfect example, as you are on your
treadmill while you talk to me. You&#39;re not only just saying it, you&#39;re actually
walking the walk!
If there were five things you could tell us to do, and obviously one of those
things could be make sure that your fat ratio is not above 28, what would you
say?
Dr. Michael Greger: Well, in terms of the current pandemic, it really comes
down to distance, distance, distance. There is a lot of talk about masking and
how effective masks are. My concern is that masks will make people
complacent.
People may put themselves, with a mask on, in situations that they might not
otherwise, like indoor, crowded, confined spaces with poor ventilation. That&#39;s
really the most dangerous place to be during a pandemic, whether you have
a mask on or not. Really the best way to reduce your risk is to put as much
distance between yourself and those outside your bubble, as possible, mask
or not, vaccine or not right now.
As frustrating as it might be, as much as we want to hug everybody, this is the
time we need to maintain that social distance. The last thing anyone wants to
do is to put a loved one at risk. Distance!
Then of course, taking better care of ourselves. This is the time to clean up
your diet.
Rebekah Kelley: I should be on a treadmill right now, talking to you!

Dr. Michael Greger: There is a free app called Dr. Greger&#39;s Daily Dozen, where I
talk about some of the healthiest of healthy foods and I encourage people to
fit it into their daily routine. You can start playing around with that.
Yes, exercise is important, not only for boosting one&#39;s immune system, but for
helping you sleep. That sleeping alone will help boost your immune system.
It&#39;s kind of a twofer: exercise and just not being sedentary. Prolonged sitting
has adverse health consequences beyond just the lack of exercise. So if you
can use a standing desk while you work or you&#39;re watching a TV or something
like that, it can help reduce the risk of some of the leading killers. Heart
disease has been the number one killer of men and women every single year
for the last 100 years, from 1919 to 2019. But it wasn&#39;t in 2020 because of
pandemic risk.
The irony is that we can actually attack both heart disease and pandemic risk
together with the same diet. It may have the benefit of helping save the
planet as well. That is a diet centered around foods from fields, not factories,
foods that grow in the ground. These are our healthiest choices.
Rebekah Kelley: Be plant-based; that&#39;s going to help us out. Is there anything
you&#39;d want us to keep in mind as it relates to your book and the pandemic?
As we look toward the future, what should we be doing?
Dr. Michael Greger: This is a new age of emerging diseases. There are now
billions of feathered and curly-tailed test tubes, perfect places for new viruses
to incubate and mutate; like billions more spins at pandemic roulette. We
need to accelerate the shift away from animal protein. That can be plant-
based meats. They are kind of taking the markets by storm, from fast food
restaurants to new options in the market meat case. Even getting more
innovative, scientists are growing meat from muscle cells, with so-called
&quot;cultured meat.&quot; You&#39;re making meat without the actual animal. As long as
you&#39;re making meat without the lungs, you don&#39;t have to worry about
pandemic viruses!
As long as you&#39;re making meat without the intestines, you don&#39;t have to
worry about fecal bugs, like E coli and salmonella. There already is &quot;clean
energy&quot; – this would be a kind of &quot;clean meat&quot;! You could make as much as
you wanted, and you don&#39;t have to worry about animal welfare issues or

greenhouse gas emissions. It&#39;s much less energy intensive and water
intensive. In fact, Singapore is the first country in the world to actually allow
the sale of cultured meat. It&#39;s actually being sold commercially now. Hopefully
that will be yet another option to move the human populous away from
raising animals for food, because that is the source of all viral pandemic
disease.
Rebekah Kelley: It blew my mind when I read that. And now, when you go
into the grocery store, there are so many plant- and nut-based products like
oat milk, almond milk, macadamia milk, and all the different kinds of cheeses.
I don&#39;t know anything about cultured meat, but there are definitely many
plant-based options, even in some of the fast food restaurants.
Dr. Michael Greger: It&#39;s like the dairy-free milks. Now there&#39;s meat made from
soybeans, meat made from wheat, meat being from peas. If it&#39;s healthier, it
tastes the same, and it&#39;s crispy, then we&#39;ll give it a try.
Rebekah Kelley: If we could wrap up the conversation, and you would say, all
right Rebekah, these are my top three to five things that I want to leave with
everyone, what would those three to five things be?
Dr. Michael Greger: I encourage people – we have two very safe, very effective
vaccines, at a blazing speed. I say in the book there&#39;s no way we&#39;re going to
have the majority of the population vaccinated before this summer. But we
may actually beat that prediction, which just blows me away. We&#39;ve never
come up with a vaccine this fast for a new pathogen. We have data on its
safety and efficacy now, so really it&#39;s just about the political will to get it
available. If you have the chance, particularly if you are older or if have one of
these preexisting conditions, you should jump at the at the chance.
Hopefully with enough of us vaccinated, we can extinguish this virus.
The only way the virus spreads is if there are enough susceptible individuals
for the viral sparks to jump from one individual to another. Immune
individuals who can&#39;t get or transmit the virus act like firebreaks to slow the
spread, or like control rods in the nuclear reactor to break the chains of
transmission and achieve this herd immunity. That&#39;s the only way we&#39;re going
to squash this pandemic. And the sooner the better!

Rebekah Kelley: What was your quote about isolating? &quot;You can&#39;t get to the
virus and the virus can&#39;t get to you.&quot;
Dr. Michael Greger: Yes. It&#39;s not spontaneous. You only get infected by other
people, so as much as possible, stay away from other people. It&#39;s easier said
than done. But for those who have seen it with their own eyes or had a friend
or family come down with COVID, it can be really a devastating illness. You
don&#39;t want to look back with regret, hurting someone else, or yourself being
hurt. We really need to just stick with it. I know there&#39;s a lot of pandemic
fatigue setting in. But we need to keep it up and get on the other side.
And we do that by distancing, primarily, and then herd immunity through
vaccination.
Rebekah Kelley: Vaccination. Distancing. And is there a third?
Dr. Michael Greger: Taking care of yourself! Self care. So if you do get infected,
you will reduce your chances of a serious case.
Rebekah Kelley: Well, Dr. Greger, thanks again for being on the show. We
appreciate having you; it&#39;s been a complete pleasure. I&#39;m such a big fan, and
this has been a special treat for me.

Rebekah Kelley: Welcome to the Humanized podcast, all about personalizing your health.
I&#39;m your host, Rebekah Kelley. Today we&#39;ll be exploring Respiratory Health with Dr. Rav
Ivker. Before I introduce Dr. Ivker, I want to remind everyone to subscribe, to receive all of
our variety of casts, in audio, video and transcription, at HumanizedHealth.com. I also would
like to thank our lead sponsor, Village Green Apothecary, at MyVillageGreen.com.
A little bit about our guest. Our guest, Dr. Robert, or Rav Ivker, has been practicing medicine
for nearly 50 years. He is a holistic health healer, family physician, cannabis clinician, health
educator, and the author of eight books, including the best-selling Sinus Survival, Asthma
Survival, The Complete Self- Guide to Holistic Medicine, and his latest book in 2017, Cannabis
for Chronic Pain. Since 2011, in his Fully Alive medical practice in Boulder, Colorado, he has
worked with nearly 10,000 chronic pain patients using medical marijuana to relieve their
suffering. Dr. Ivker is a board certified integrative holistic physician, the co-founder and past
president of the American Board of Integrative Holistic Medicine, past president of the
American Holistic Medical Association, and a fellow of the American Academy of Family
Physicians.
Thank you so much, Dr. Ivker, for being with us. And my first question, like so many diseases
today, respiratory problems are on the rise. What is going on?
Rav Ivker: It began in 1980, when I was given what I&#39;d call a death sentence. I was suffering
with chronic sinusitis. I was just given that diagnosis by an ear nose and throat doctor who
told me that I would have to learn to live with it. He first offered me surgery, but then he did
qualify that and said he couldn&#39;t really guarantee that the surgery would cure the problem.
So I responded, well why in the world would I want to do surgery then, or have surgery? So I
walked out of his office feeling like I just couldn&#39;t live with this misery. I was only 33 years
old at the time and the prospect of living the rest of my life with this miserable chronic
sinusitis was really awful – I can&#39;t tell you. I made a commitment to curing it. I really had no
idea how I would do it, but that was really the beginning of this field that I have focused on
now for 40 years, respiratory healing.
It&#39;s important to recognize that healing, that the word &quot;healing&quot; – heal, health and wholly –
all are derived from the Anglo-Saxon word &quot;haelen&quot; – it means to make whole. And that
health and healing are far more than the absence of disease, but a state of wholeness and
balance of body, mind, and spirit. Respiratory healing has now become a specialty within
what I call Fully Alive Medicine. That&#39;s how I describe my practice – my practice in Boulder,
Colorado is Fully Alive Medicine. It&#39;s defined as the care of the whole person: body, mind,
emotions, relationships and spirit. It&#39;s based on one fundamental belief that unconditional
love is life&#39;s most powerful healer and the perceived loss of love is our greatest health risk –
and respiratory healing is just a method for loving your nose, sinuses and lungs. Those are
the three components of the respiratory tract.
The primary cause of respiratory disease – and I&#39;m focused on the most common of the
respiratory conditions, chronic sinusitis, asthma and allergies – the primary cause is chronic

inflammation of the mucosa, which is the outer lining of the tissue covering the entire
respiratory tract, the nose, sinuses and lungs.
There are many contributors to inflammation of the mucus membrane, and the most
common and probably the most significant contributor is smoking. This program, the
Respiratory Healing Program, which I now call the Fully Alive Breathe Easy Program, is quite
effective for preventing and treating, and even curing, these chronic respiratory conditions.
But if you continue to smoke, it&#39;s very difficult for the program to be successful. So smoking
is really the most significant, but air quality and infection, a weak immune system, your diet,
allergies, and possibly right behind smoking as the most significant, are our emotions. The
mind-body connection is fascinating, but it&#39;s really an important contributor that is often
overlooked, except in holistic medicine.
So optimal air quality is air that&#39;s clean, you can&#39;t see it or smell it; it&#39;s moist, between 35 and
55% relative humidity; it&#39;s warm, between 65 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit; it&#39;s filled with
oxygen and negative ions, and fortunately, technology has made it possible to create
optimal air quality indoors.
As polluted as our outdoor air is, the indoor air can be a hundred times more polluted than
outdoor air, but we have really good air cleaners and negative ion generators that can help
to create optimal air quality. And humidifiers.
So, infection. And we&#39;re talking about viral, bacterial and fungal infections. The common cold
is the most frequent trigger for respiratory infections. The common cold is the most
common trigger for sinus infections and acute asthmatic attacks. So, if we can prevent colds,
we can usually prevent sinus infections, as well as asthmatic attacks. Infections are – both
infections, sinus infections, bronchitis – are often treated with broad spectrum antibiotics
and with multiple courses of antibiotics, and along with an unhealthy diet, it can cause,
candida overgrowth, or fungal sinusitis. That term was first used, it was a landmark study
from the Mayo clinic in 1999, when they concluded that all cases of chronic sinusitis were
caused by a fungus. And I had been seeing that and treating... most of my severe cases of
chronic sinusitis were actually fungal sinusitis and are caused by a candida overgrowth.
The diet. You want to avoid... it&#39;s really an anti-inflammatory, hypoallergenic and candida
controlled diet. The focus is on avoiding inflammatory foods which are more acidic, refined
sugar and sugar-containing foods. Milk and dairy products are right at the top of the list. Red
meat is in there, and you want to focus on alkaline foods, the green leafy and low starch
vegetables. These are the low-glycemic index and in my books, Sinus Survival and Asthma
Survival, I described this diet in detail and I have the glycemic index tables. You want 3 and
6% on the glycemic index, fruits and vegetables. No higher than that.
And, emotions, I mentioned earlier. This I find as the most fascinating. I mean, it&#39;s been so
interesting to me, since I began focusing on treating respiratory conditions in the 1980s. In
the late 1980s – I had cured my own chronic sinus in 1987 and after that, my practice was
really focused on treating chronic sinusitis and asthma and allergies. I saw a striking
similarity in the personality traits of people who were sinus sufferers. They tended to be
high achievers and perfectionists who held themselves to a very high standard of

performance. They were very hard on themselves. And the emotion that was very often
associated with sinusitis was a high level of repressed anger, and the anger was often
directed at themselves for making mistakes, or perceived mistakes. And the asthmatics were
very highly sensitive to disharmony in their physical, emotional and social environment. And
there was a diminished sense of freedom of expression. And there was often enmeshment, a
smothering love, usually from their mother, and a lack of joy from an acute sense of loss.
Their grief – grief was the primary emotion associated with asthma, and grief stems from
their abandonment, physical and/or emotional, usually from their father. There was a lack of
nurturing touch and affection as an infant or child, and the absence of bonding between
parents of the asthmatic child, all of which add up to the perceived loss of love. And to me, it
was really amazing to see the similarity of these asthmatics, and with these personality
traits. And the emotion, the primary emotion associated with these physical conditions,
mind-body connection is so powerful.
At National Jewish Hospital, an internationally recognized, respiratory disease center, they
did a 10-year study on children and in families that experienced intense levels of stress, they
were three to four times more likely to develop asthma.

Rebekah Kelley: Welcome to the Humanized Podcast, all about personalizing
your health. I am your host, Rebekah Kelley. Today we&#39;re going to be
exploring the Fully Alive Breathe Easy Program with Dr. Rav Ivker. Before I
introduce Dr. Ivker, I want to remind everyone to subscribe, to get all our
variety of casts in audio, video and transcription at HumanizedHealth.com. I
also want to thank our lead sponsor, Village Green Apothecary at
MyVillageGreen.com.
Today&#39;s guest, Dr. Rav Ivker, has been practicing medicine for nearly 50 years.
He is a holistic healer, family physician, cannabis clinician, health educator,
and author of eight books, including the bestselling, Sinus Survival, Asthma
Survival, The Complete Self Care Guide to Holistic Medicine, and his latest
book from 2017, Cannabis for Chronic Pain.
Since 2011, in his Fully Alive Medicine practice in Boulder, Colorado, he has
worked with nearly 10,000 chronic pain patients using medical marijuana to
relieve their suffering. Dr. Ivker is a board certified, integrative holistic
physician, the co-founder and past president of the American Board of
Integrative Holistic Medicine, past president of the American Holistic Medical
Association, and a fellow of the American Academy of Family Physicians.
Thank you so much for being here, Dr. Ivker. One of the first questions I want
to ask you is, what is the key ingredient to be successful with the Fully Alive
Breathe Easy Program?
Rav Ivker: This program was developed as a result of what began as my own
personal quest to cure my chronic sinusitis back in the 1980s. It has evolved
for over 40 years. The Fully Alive Breathe Easy Program is a synthesis and an
update of the Sinus Survival and Asthma Survival programs that I&#39;ve
developed over these past 30 years. I presented it in the editions of Sinus
Survival and the book, Asthma Survival.
The primary objective of the program is to heal the chronically inflamed
respiratory mucosa. This is the tissue that&#39;s lining our entire respiratory tract.
It&#39;s been very effective, primarily because it addresses each of the causes of
the inflammation of the respiratory tract. The respiratory tract consists of just
the nose, sinuses, and the lungs.
As most of the listeners have heard, the body will heal itself; it&#39;s a self-healing
organism. The problem is, that&#39;s true if you can help the body to heal itself. I
mean, a perfect example is if you broke your leg and you were in a long leg
cast for and on crutches for 6 weeks, and you went back and got an x-ray
after 6 weeks and the bone was completely healed – well, what did you do for

6 weeks? You had no weight bearing at all; you were not using your leg.
Unfortunately, you cannot do that with the respiratory tract because it&#39;s
always in use, 24/7. We&#39;re breathing on average about 25,000 times a day. So
the challenge of healing the inflamed respiratory mucosa is that it&#39;s always in
use. There are so many components; it&#39;s not, here take this pill and your
respiratory tract will be healed. Not so.
You really have to address all of the contributors to the inflammation. That
involves not smoking, right at the top of the list. I mean, this program is quite
effective, but it&#39;s very difficult to do with a person who has continued to
smoke.
Enhancing indoor air quality, treating viral and bacterial infection, treating
candida overgrowth or fungal sinusitis, or fungal asthma, practicing nasal
hygiene on a daily basis, reducing inflammation and allergies, strengthening
your immune system, opening your airway, breathing consciously, and
healing the issues in your tissues. I&#39;ve referred to the emotions that play such
a huge role in contributing to the inflammation of the respiratory tract. So
these are all of the components. When all of them are practiced on a regular
basis, people make amazing recoveries. In fact, most of my patients are able
to cure their sinusitis and asthma.
Enhancing indoor air quality is not so difficult these days because we have
really good air cleaners, HEPA air cleaners, or negative ion generators.
If you need a good furnace filter, the Filtrete, by 3M; it&#39;s available in almost all
hardware stores. Air duct cleaning services are available in most cities now.
Carpet cleaning. Indoor plants – there are a number of them that serve as air
cleaners while adding oxygen to the air: spider plants, dracaena, pathos,
chrysanthemums, all of them are effective.
100% pure allicin, the active ingredient in garlic. In England where Allimed is
made, they&#39;ve done studies that have documented how effective it is in
killing MRSA. MRSA is the flesh-eating staph that&#39;s resistant to almost all
antibiotics. And it [allicin] kills cold viruses, and it&#39;s antifungal besides. So all of
the infections that contribute to chronic sinusitis and bronchitis respond to
Allimed.
For candida overgrowth, fungal sinusitis, and fungal asthma, I also use – in
addition to Allimed – Candisol, caprylic acid, grapefruit seed extract, and
oregano; are all effective antifungals. The diet is a candida-control, anti-

inflammatory and hypoallergenic diet, which is described in detail in both of
my books, Asthma Survival and Sinus Survival. Probiotics are also used in
treating the fungal problem.
Practicing nasal hygiene, I still do it even though I was able to cure my
sinusitis in 1987. I still practice nasal hygiene on a daily basis. This includes the
Sinus Survival Herbal Spray, plus peppermint oil, which I do two or three
times a day. For people who are actively treating their chronic sinusitis, I have
them spraying every 2 to 3 hours.
Steam inhalers are terrific. Essential oils, eucalyptus and peppermint and tea
tree oil, go directly to where you want it to work. They get down into your
lungs and you get direct contact with the mucous membrane. That&#39;s a
treatment that should be done anywhere from two to four times a day while
you&#39;re in the midst of treating your respiratory condition. The steaming
should be followed immediately with nasal irrigation.
There&#39;s something you pulse, which is a pulsatile irrigator. It uses the same
technology as the Waterpik device that is used on your teeth. But the
SinuPulse is the only irrigating device that removes the biofilm. It&#39;s a thick
mucus coating on the mucus membrane, and it allows the essential oils and
the verbal nasal spray to get direct contact with your mucous membrane.
So I do recommend the SinuPulse and drinking a lot of water, at least a half an
ounce per pound of body weight. If you weigh 160, you should be drinking at
least 80 ounces of filtered water, not tap water.
There are a number of anti-inflammatory supplements, but it&#39;s the anti-
inflammatory diet that is most important. B6, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), grape
seed extract, fish oil, omega-3, turmeric and CBD/cannabidiol, are all effective
anti-inflammatory supplements.
And for asthma, I usually add mullein and Pneumo Complex made by MPR,
allergy supplements, grape seed extract, quercetin, bromelain, nettles and
vitamin C.
People overlook this all the time; if you can sleep 7 to 9 hours a night, it
strengthens your immune system like nothing else will. Exercise is also
recommended for strengthening the immune system: 150 to 300 minutes a
week of mild to moderate aerobic exercise. And there are the supplements:
vitamin D3 and C, probiotics, and the probiotic Del-Immune V are all excellent
for strengthening immunity.

Opening your airway and breathing consciously. There are natural
broncodilators, magnesium, lobelia, ephedra, or ma huang, and the product,
Resprin, which I&#39;ve been recommending lately, is very effective.
As you wean off your pharmaceutical inhalers, you use the natural
broncodilators and practice breathing consciously. You can use any one of
several methods: abdominal breathing, the yogic, Ujjayi, or pranayama, and
most recently the Wim Hof technique. All of these methods emphasize a slow
exhale. The emphasis is on the exhale.
Then last, but certainly not least, I&#39;ve found possibly the most effective way to
heal the respiratory tract is by healing the issues in your tissues. And that
refers to the emotions, the primary emotions, that have resulted from
childhood trauma or the perceived loss of love as a child, which is a form of
trauma.
Most of us with respiratory issues have experienced the perceived loss of love:
from a highly critical parent, or a smothering mother, whatever it is. The result
is a perceived loss of love. Acceptance of yourself, your emotions and
behavior, practicing mindfulness, and feeling your feelings. Identify goals, find
affirmations to correspond to your goals, and meditation and/or prayer. All of
these are effective methods for healing your life. Because that&#39;s what you&#39;re
doing. This is a life-changing program. I just really want to emphasize that. It&#39;s
not just about fixing bad sinuses or lungs.

Rebekah Kelley: Welcome to the Humanized podcast, all about personalizing your
health. I am your host, Rebekah Kelley. We have a great guest, Dr. Joel Kahn, and the
subject of today&#39;s discussion is How to Never Die of Heart Disease. Before I introduce
Dr. Kahn, I want to remind everyone to subscribe to get all of our variety of casts in
audio, video and transcription at HumanizedHealth.com. I&#39;d also like to thank our
lead sponsor, Village Green Apothecary, at MyVillageGreen.com.
A little bit about Dr. Joel Kahn. He is a practicing cardiologist and clinical professor at
Wayne State University School of Medicine. He graduated summa cum laude from
the University of Michigan Medical School. He&#39;s known as America&#39;s healthy heart
doc. Dr. Kahn has triple board certification in internal medicine, cardiovascular
medicine and interventional cardiology. He believes that plant-based nutrition is the
most powerful source of preventative medicine. And Dr. Khan has authored scores of
publications and passionately lectures throughout the country.
Thank you so much for being with us.
Joel Kahn: Thank you. This is like THE most important topic. It&#39;s what I do every day,
every day, every day.
Rebekah Kelley: So glad to have you, I&#39;m going to jump right into the question, right?
I just want to ask you, how do I know if I have heart disease?
Joel Kahn: You might have symptoms. So you never ignore tightness, pressure,
nausea, palpitations, particularly cold weather, exertion, big time emotions,
screaming... you never ignore that. Most people don&#39;t have symptoms. You look at
your ear lobes. There&#39;s something called an ear lobe crease, diagonal ear lobe
crease. Go look up on the internet a picture of Steven Spielberg. He&#39;s got the most
famous diagonal earlobe crease. An internist in New York city 50 years ago said when
I see that, my patients have heart disease. It took 50 years to prove it, but in the last
few years, it&#39;s about 70% accurate. Don&#39;t ignore it. Guys with erectile dysfunction are
highly likely to have clogged heart arteries. The plumbing goes together. You don&#39;t
get a blue pill. You get a cardiac work-up if you have erectile dysfunction. I wish it
was as easy with women. It just hasn&#39;t been studied as a clue in women.
Finally, finally, you don&#39;t have erectile dysfunction, you don&#39;t have an earlobe crease,
you don&#39;t have symptoms that should get attention right away. If you&#39;re over age 40,
you want to get a heart CT scan. It&#39;s called a coronary artery calcium scan. It&#39;s
basically the heart mammogram, the heart colonoscopy.
How do you know you&#39;re not walking around with some blockage? And if you knew,
would you eat different? Would you exercise different? The test was developed 31

years ago, it was over a thousand dollars. Now in Cleveland, it&#39;s free. In Detroit
where I practice, it&#39;s $75. Anybody basically for the cost of a family of four dinner
can, once in their life, we&#39;re talking once, lie down, hold your breath, no needle, no
injection – ba-doom! You find out if your arteries are clean or not. It&#39;s called a
calcium score. You want to be zero. If you&#39;re like the woman that just walked out of
my office and you&#39;re 53 years old and your calcium score is 200, you&#39;ve got a
problem. And we figured it out, it&#39;s cholesterol and it&#39;s genetics and other things,
and we&#39;ve got a plan. So take the same approach. If you&#39;re getting a mammogram
and a colonoscopy and doing preventive medicine, get the heart CT calcium scan.
You&#39;ve got to ask your primary care doctor for a prescription
Rebekah Kelley: I did not know that. Is that even discussed generally?
Joel Kahn: Sadly, it&#39;s 31 years of data, research, studies. It&#39;s slowly, like in the last 2
years, made its way into the American Heart Association guidelines. But there&#39;s
really no process to teach primary care docs, internists, gynecologists, nurse
practitioners. I talk about it, I write about it, I&#39;ve been on TV about it over and over,
and I&#39;m not the only one. But if we would implement it routinely, we would...
healthy [people, on the one hand, and] concerning [people on the other hand] – and
the concerning people need to make changes and they need to get evaluated more.
Rebekah Kelley: Amazing. Thank you so much for sharing that. That&#39;s great. What
causes heart disease that I do not know about, that I should?
Joel Kahn: Sure. The ones you should know about were discovered 50 years ago –
smoking high cholesterol, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, diabetes, and mom,
dad, brother, sister had an early heart attack or dropped dead. What have we
learned since then? Because that&#39;s all the doctors ask about, 50-year-old data,
unfortunately. You want to know about a blood test called your lipoprotein(a)
cholesterol. L I P O protein and lowercase a – lipoprotein(a) cholesterol. 20 to 25% of
people inherit a kind of cholesterol from mom, dad, or both that can clog your
arteries without symptoms. 20 or 25% – that&#39;s 90 million Americans, it&#39;s 1.5 billion
people worldwide. Test is a $30 blood test. The problem is, right now there&#39;s no
prescription drugs specifically for that cholesterol. So there&#39;s no program going on.
1% of doctors check that in their patients. I&#39;ve checked it in everybody for more than
a decade. So I have hundreds and hundreds.
If you find you&#39;re super high, then you need that CT scan we&#39;ve talked about and you
need to stay up to date. I&#39;ve written a book on the topic of what to do if you have a
high lipoprotein(a) cholesterol. But it can kill people. It can cause stroke. It can cause
heart attack or not, but you want to find out if you have it. Obviously we&#39;ve learned
more and more that diet is a big factor, more processed food, added sugar and
meat-heavy diets with butter, cheese, lard, ghee are promoting heart disease. And

we know that over and over. You want to eat whole food, plant-based, brightly
colored salads and yellow squash and baked potatoes and sweet potatoes as much,
or exclusively – you know, a vegan, a whole food plant-based diet. A factor, for sure,
because we actually – I&#39;m off track – we know new chemicals that are in the tissue of
meat that are causing clogged arteries. We can&#39;t check them in the blood, but we&#39;ve
learned the science so one called Neu5Gc is the most exciting one. There&#39;s actually
something called a red meat allergy people are developing, we never heard before,
interestingly, and it seems to attack our arteries. So that&#39;s enough. I mean air
pollution, tough one to deal with the relationship between air pollution – and I&#39;m
talking just cities, cities in the United States, not necessarily living next to a
petroleum refinery – air pollution is triggering heart attacks, strokes, leading to fetal
loss, diabetes, dementia... poor air quality. I mean, I think we all want clean water to
drink, but clean air debris is a big health issue.
Rebekah Kelley: So then are we seeing more of that happening, if it&#39;s related to
pollution in cities that are... more cities than in the country?
Joel Kahn: Yeah, absolutely. There&#39;s data. The closer you live to a highway, the
higher is your heart attack rate. Fascinating. In Sydney, or Beijing when they had the
Olympics in 2008, they looked at heart attack rates before the Olympics, then they
turned the factories off. The air quality got better. Then they turned the factories on.
Heart attacks are high. Better air quality, heart attacks drop. Turn the factories back
on, heart attacks went back up.
There are studies like that that show us this is a real deal. It&#39;s a tough one. Anytime
you can be out in nature. Some people have air filter systems in their home. I&#39;m a fan
of that. And just being cognizant, standing next to somebody, smoking, standing next
to a truck spewing garbage out of the tailpipe – and be a little aware of all that.
Rebekah Kelley: So what can I do today? What actions can I take? What is it that I
can do to make sure that I don&#39;t die?
Joel Kahn: Other than looking up and scheduling a heart calcium CT scan, maybe
asking your doctor for a little bit more advanced blood work to include the
lipoprotein(a) cholesterol level. It&#39;s food. Food&#39;s not enough, but food is important. I
mean, whatever your, you know... add a salad to your dinner today. Eat an apple,
not a bagel or a donut. Go take a walk after dinner, helps control your blood sugar
and lowers your cholesterol and inflammation. Focus today on 7 hours sleep. There&#39;s
an interesting two studies from Europe that if you can schedule 7 or 7 1/2 hours
sleep versus less, you drop your heart attack rate as much as a prescription drug. So,
you know, with cell phones and iPads and all the rest, you know, we often aren&#39;t
sleeping the way nature has prescribed, but it&#39;s an important goal. Those are all
things you can do today. High tech, but also high touch.

Rebekah Kelley: So with sleep, you know, there&#39;s a lot of sleep apps now, a lot of
people are struggling with sleep. I actually, my goal is seven... so it&#39;s, you know, it&#39;s a
goal. If I get more than that, I&#39;m super happy. So sleep, food, testing, right? Going
and getting things tested. So what else would you say would be the other thing that
might be...
Joel Kahn: Yeah. Obviously, quit smoking, quit smoking, quit smoking. We&#39;ve still got
15, 18% of Americans that smoke. It&#39;s clearly a potent factor for developing early
cancer, stroke, heart disease.
You know, we talked about fitness, whether you like to walk, whether you like to
really work out hard, it doesn&#39;t matter. Just don&#39;t sit all day long. Sitting ages you,
sitting raises your blood sugar, sitting may raise your blood cholesterol and
inflammation.
Rebekah Kelley: And is that where the 10,000 step comes in?
Joel Kahn: It&#39;s not a bad goal. You know, the American Heart Association says 22
minutes a day of moderate to vigorous exercise. That&#39;s another goal. 22 minutes a
day is not too scary to most people.
Now, finally, don&#39;t ignore snoring and sleep problems. That&#39;s part of the sleep issue.
Snoring is more common because more Americans are overweight and obese, and
sleep apnea, a real medical condition, is more common – in some people, reversible
by losing weight. But if your partner says you&#39;re snoring or you know you&#39;re snoring,
it&#39;s very easy to get a home sleep study, actually define if you have pathologic
snoring, sleep apnea, and get it fixed. It could be taping your mouth at night so you
breathe through your nose, could be mouth devices, could be the, you know, the
horrible mask, Darth Vader, that a lot of people wear called C-PAP – but it&#39;ll age your
brain and probably age your heart if you ignore sleep problems like loud snoring with
apneic episodes. And it&#39;s really easy now at home to get a home sleep study, through
a doctor&#39;s office.

Now, besides being the host of Humanized Health podcast, Rebekah is a marketing consultant
with expertise in health, wellness, and active lifestyle sectors. Her focus in life is to create the
best self and develop a vibrant, energetic and strong body in alignment with a strong mind and
spirit. Rebekah is passionate about sharing her experience and knowledge on healing and
personal growth to the world, as well as continuing her learning journey with others – and I
think you&#39;ve all noticed that as you&#39;ve seen Rebekah host our shows. And so she has created
Virtue Skinfood. That&#39;s a line of products using the wisdom of natural plant medicine and food
grade nutrition to provide a line of optimal skincare products. It is the cleanest line I have ever
seen. She originally developed products for her own use to help solve her skin sensitivity
challenges. By following Rebekah&#39;s unique and integrated wellness practices, anyone can have a
healthier body, inside and out.
And I just want to comment, as we start this interview. I have watched you, you are a dedicated
worker. You have so much going on, you stay really fit, and I&#39;ve been in Village Green looking at
your products. So, you must know a lot about skin, so that&#39;s what we want to talk about.
Do you find that most people really understand how important their skin is to their overall
health?
Rebekah Kelley: You know, David, I think it&#39;s hit and miss, right? Because I think it&#39;s so easy for
us to take our skin for granted. And some people do pay attention, especially if they&#39;re having
skin issues. But I think a lot of times, myself included, it&#39;s very easy to just expect your skin to
continue to do its work, to protect you, to detox, to do all the things that you really depend
upon it to do to look good, to feel good, and sometimes we can forget about it.
And I don&#39;t think a lot of people even think about the fact that it actually is our largest organ.
Right? And I think the numbers that I read were like 20 to 25 square feet of skin is on every
body, every person. And it&#39;s really the opportunity for our body to detox, but also to take in
things. So, toxins, obviously, can take in. But you know, there&#39;s a lot of medications now, and
other things like hormone creams or nicotine, right? So if you put it right on your skin, your skin
will absorb it.

We all know about keeping our skin hydrated. We don&#39;t always think about doing it from
actually drinking water. We think about putting lotions or something on it, but really, your skin
is a map to what&#39;s going on inside of your body. And I think whenever it starts to say things by
creating rashes or breakouts or wrinkles, we start paying attention. But until then, probably not
as much as we would like, do people really notice what our skin&#39;s about.
David Stouder: Well, yeah, and I think we need to really focus in on the things you just said,
that the skin is an organ. It has a function. It&#39;s not just something that wraps up our bones and
our organs and gives us an outward appearance. It is a very integral part of our health and it
seems like it, like you say, we ignore it until it talks to us, till we get a rash, we go, wow, my
skin&#39;s so wrinkly, what&#39;s going on?
Now, let&#39;s talk about some of these things that our skin does that gets our attention. There&#39;s so
many things, like acne, pimples, wrinkles, rashes... Does that give us some clues about what&#39;s
going on inside our body?
Rebekah Kelley: Yeah, I think it&#39;s really individualistic, right? I think it&#39;s really important that
each individual pay attention to what&#39;s going on in their body. And sometimes we get so busy in
life that if our skin starts giving us a little trouble, we might go to the dermatologist. We might
put some cream on it. But we don&#39;t always stop and really listen to what it has to say. So for
instance, for me, I can always tell, especially in the winter, but sometimes in the summer when
I&#39;m not drinking enough water, my skin tells me first by actually being really dry. And so I have a
lot of people come to me, because I have skincare line, saying my skin&#39;s really dry, what do I put
on it? And I always start with the first thing – how much water are you drinking? Because that
makes a huge difference with your skin. Right? So it just talks to us in such little subtle ways. I
can definitely tell a difference between having a couple of glasses of wine with my girlfriends&#39;
book club. The next day, my skin just feels and looks a little bit different and it&#39;s because it&#39;s not
well hydrated, it&#39;s a little inflamed. So our skin&#39;s constantly talking to us.
I know for me also, the reason why, of course, that I work on skin and think about skin is
because my skin talks to me a lot. So I know I&#39;ve actually taken even a different supplement and
I&#39;ll get a rash on my stomach. And I was like, wow, it&#39;s because I took a time-release. I can&#39;t
handle time-release. Different people have to listen to their body and see, okay, what&#39;s it saying
to me? If you go to sleep and then you wake up the next day and your eyes are a little swollen,
are you thinking, wow, did I maybe wash my laundry in something and now this is a toxin that
I&#39;m being exposed to, that I wasn&#39;t being exposed to before? Maybe you stay at a hotel and you
sleep on their sheets and you have a little bit of [a reaction] – do people think about that? I
know I do. But it&#39;s just something, your skin is always talking to you.
Things like eczema and psoriasis – those are all things your body&#39;s basically saying it needs to
detox, right? There&#39;s other systems and issues that are backed up and they need to have a little
bit of support. And so the skin, I believe for my skin anyway, it&#39;s always talking to me and it&#39;s
about listening, but it&#39;s very personal, right? I would have breakouts on my chin forever, until I

actually quit dairy, and they&#39;re gone. And it&#39;s just little things like that sometimes, that you&#39;ll be
like, you tweak something, you&#39;re like, wow. It&#39;s creating a little bit of indigestion and it&#39;s
creating a little problem for me. And now if I ever break down and have some dairy, it comes
right back.
David Stouder: Yeah. And I like the way that you&#39;re focusing us on, we see something on the
outside, on our skin, a rash, a blemish or whatever, and we want to look what&#39;s going on on the
inside. Because yeah, there&#39;s things like poison Ivy that comes from the outside and gets on the
skin and causes inflammation. But it seems to me that most skin issues, although they&#39;re on the
outside, they come from the inside. Not a hundred percent, but I like where you&#39;re going with
that, because I think that&#39;s what we need to look at.
Now, there&#39;s probably, like you said, it&#39;s very personalized your skin and its health, but what
are some of the main things people do or don&#39;t do? You mentioned hydration that sort of
caused their skin to start hollering at them, hey, take care of me.
Rebekah Kelley: Well, one of the obvious ones to me is a lot of times people really, I would say,
overuse skincare products. Or they can scrub too hard. Cause a lot of times people think their
skin&#39;s just inherently dirty and they&#39;ve just got to clean, clean, clean, and actually your skin is
amazing at actually cleaning itself. It&#39;s really about removing the environmental toxins. And
that&#39;s actually a very gentle thing to do. People, I think, more and more do realize that they
need to protect their skin from sun, but I think a lot of times people do it with sunscreen, which
also has a lot of chemicals and synthetics in it. It&#39;s really hard to get a natural sunscreen. So
while you&#39;re doing a great job of protecting your skin from sun, you&#39;re also putting something
on your skin that it might not necessarily like. So I know for me, I&#39;m a big hat wearer and long
sleeve wearer in the sun.
People just don&#39;t always think about, also, like when you go in the shower. In your shower a lot
of people have city water or they have other water that has chlorine in it. So they&#39;re daily
putting on their skin the shower water, breathing it in. Nope, [they] don&#39;t even think about
that.
So there&#39;s so many different things that are just really simple everyday living that really can
create some challenges for the health of our skin. And we really want to be thoughtful. Like I
actually put a filter on my shower water, and it makes a huge difference with my skin. It&#39;s little
simple things like that, that you can actually look in your environment and say, what can I do to
really take care of myself? I have a hat that I roll up and carry in my backpack. So if I&#39;m any
place unexpectedly where it&#39;s sunny, I can pop it out and put it over, and I protect myself. It&#39;s
just different things that we can think about and be smart about. What&#39;s our environment,
where are we going to be, and what can we do to take care of ourselves?

David Stouder: And if I may say, and having met you in person, your skin is a great example that
you&#39;re following your principles, I just want to say. We won&#39;t talk about your age, but you have
excellent skin.
Now, what are some of the, again, this is very personal and there&#39;s a lot of things to be said, but
you mentioned when you stopped dairy, blemishes on your chin cleared up. What are some of
the key dietary things that people should look at that might be affecting their skin in a negative
way?
Rebekah Kelley: There are so many, and because we&#39;re such diverse individuals with different
biochemical situations going on, it can really vary. So again, this is where I really think people
should reflect and pay attention to what their body&#39;s saying, right? You know how you feel after
you eat something or drink something. But there are certainly some things that are kind of
basic, which we discussed. Hydration. And kind of the key for that, a minimum to me is just
making sure you&#39;re getting like a half an ounce, I think, for every pound, was kind of the rule. I
like to double that, myself. But it&#39;s really, again, a very personal thing. But you can tell when
you&#39;re starting to feel a little dehydrated, right? You can kind of tell that that&#39;s happening.
You also want to make sure to have a – I feel like I&#39;m just preaching to the choir, of course,
because of our listeners – but you know, you have a very diverse, colorful, diet with lots of
dense nutrition, right? Because your skin really needs to have the support that your diet
provides you. So you want dense nutrition. There&#39;s a reason why, if you eat French fries, it can
show up in your skin. Those oils are just really not good for our skin and different people have
different responses and reactions. So it&#39;s really hard, but the rule is, don&#39;t eat the things that
you know you shouldn&#39;t eat, right? If you do eat them, most likely you&#39;re going to see a
difference. And I hate to say it, but I&#39;m going to say it – sugar can be one that really affects skin.
A lot of people will notice, when they lean a little bit on the dessert side, it&#39;s a tendency to have
breakouts. And also, if you get your body out of whack, there&#39;s a lot of things that can happen
around candida growth, et cetera.
So, it&#39;s really about knowing what your body can and can&#39;t handle. Eating as dense nutrition as
you can, making sure that you hydrate. And again, I know I keep saying this over and over again,
but really listen to your skin. Listen to what it has to say. It really wants to talk to you.
And also, be grateful. You were very nice to compliment my skin, David, but my skin, I&#39;ve had a
lot of trouble throughout my life. I started out with very bad cystic acne. I react to everything,
as you can kind of tell from the way I talk about my environment, and I still travel with my own
sheets because I can&#39;t stay in a hotel if they&#39;ve used the wrong laundry detergent. I really do
listen to myself. And when my body says something, or if I wake up with swollen eyes, I&#39;m
grateful. If I get a breakout, I&#39;m grateful. I know it sounds weird to say, but I&#39;m grateful because
my skin&#39;s telling me what my overall health is. It&#39;s the canary in the coal mine. And I just say to
myself, okay, what&#39;s going on? What have I done differently? What can I do? And then when it

starts to glow again, I&#39;m like, wow, okay, I&#39;m back to doing what I need to do to take good care
of myself. So your skin is like a great way of really measuring that and really listening.
David Stouder: Well, I&#39;m going to steal a phrase there, because I think it&#39;s a good one. When
people come in, I guess you&#39;ll remember, your skin is the canary in the coal mine.
Well, those were a lot of really valuable insights, Rebekah, and thank you. Now, as I tell you
that, you can find out information at www.Virtue, just like the word, VirtueSkinfood.com, we

of the skin and your own challenges with your skin, I want to have you back and talk about your
actual skincare line. There are so many, a lot of good ones, but ask you what&#39;s unique about
yours.

David Stouder: Welcome to the Humanized podcast, all about personalizing your health. I&#39;m
your guest host today, Dave Stouder, and today we&#39;ll be talking about Learning to Nourish your
Skin with Rebekah Kelley. You may recognize Rebekah because she is the usual host here at
HumanizedHealth.com, but we&#39;re going ask her about her skincare line because she is the
creator of Virtue Skinfood. But I do want to remind you before we start the interview to
subscribe and get our whole variety of casts. You can get just audio. You can get transcriptions.
They&#39;re all free and they&#39;re at HumanizedHealth.com, and we invite you to subscribe. And I&#39;d
like to thank our lead sponsor, Village Green Apothecary, at MyVillageGreen.com, where you
can come in and talk to me or any of our wonderful staff and you can actually see, experience
and purchase any of the Virtue Skinfood lines.
Now, Rebekah is a marketing consultant with expertise in health, wellness, and active lifestyle
factors. Her focus in life is to create the best self and develop a vibrant, energetic, and strong
body in alignment with a strong mind and spirit. Rebekah is passionate about sharing her
experience and knowledge on healing, personal growth, as well as continuing her learning
journey with others. Not only is Rebekah, as I said, the host of Humanized Health, but she has
created her own skincare line, Virtue Skinfood. Now, this is a line of products that uses the
wisdom of natural plant medicine and food grade nutrition to provide a line of optimal skincare
products. She originally developed these products for her own use to solve her skin sensitivity
challenges. By following Rebekah&#39;s unique and integrated wellness practices, anyone can have a
healthier body, inside and out.
Well, Rebekah, it&#39;s fun to have you back here as a guest. So you can just relax and answer the
questions and take it easy.
But now, you know, sometimes I watch people when they deal with their skin, not only with
skin issues, but makeup and looking attractive and presenting your best face, if you will. It
seems that people sometimes think that skincare items are like, sort of painting a house. Like
this is just like coloring my shirt a different color, and that they&#39;re not really thinking of, they&#39;re
putting stuff on... they&#39;re feeding their skin whatever they&#39;re putting on it. Is that sort of how
you... is that an issue that led you to create this skincare line?
Rebekah Kelley: Completely David, you nailed it. Matter of fact, obviously, Virtue SkinFOOD. So
skincare, I look at as it&#39;s food for your skin. So I literally put it in the name of my skincare
because I believe and know whatever you put on your skin, you do absorb, depending upon
where you put it on your skin. Obviously different areas of the body are more sensitive than
others. But we know that there&#39;s more permeability, for instance, in the genital area, the facial
area, and then there&#39;s going to be less around the rest of the body. So you get more absorption
depending upon where you put it. And to me, that means it&#39;s definitely not painting a house.
It&#39;s definitely an organ that takes it in. So yes, I would agree with you on that.

David Stouder: Okay. And this is sort of a, it&#39;s not a trick question, but how many synthetic
ingredients do we want in our skincare?
Rebekah Kelley: It is personalized health, obviously. Right? So everybody&#39;s going to make a
different call on that one. And I don&#39;t want to lay on anybody my values, but I do think that,
ideally, zero. Is that possible? In the United States, definitely not. But I was actually... I just
wanted to Google because I was trying to remember. The EU, I know bans a certain amount,
and then the United States bans a certain amount. FDA. FDA oversees cosmetics and skincare.
So I did look it up and apparently the EU law bans 1,328 chemicals and the United States bans
11. So there are a lot of products right now in the market which would be illegal in Europe. And
then the average woman uses, I think they say 12 different beauty products every day. I think
that&#39;s a low number. I think it&#39;s higher than that, but you think of cleansers, conditioners, hair
dyes, fragrances, skincare products, lotions, nail polish, makeup, right? Like there&#39;s... I think
there&#39;s way more than 12. We&#39;re a little low on that.
David Stouder: So, shampoo, conditioner, yeah.
Rebekah Kelley: I mean, all of that is your body burden. And then if you add in cleaning
products because that also goes through your skin. So while it&#39;s skincare related, you have to
think of anything that touches your skin. That just really speaks to the fact that we also want to
be looking at even very natural, non-synthetic cleaning products.
So, ideally zero. But when I say that, I understand that a lot of women, we focus on being
attractive. Not that men don&#39;t, but I feel like it definitely is something that sits squarely in the
female gender. So I have had a lot of people say to me, hey Rebekah, I really appreciate how
clean your skincare is, but I just need those chemicals. They&#39;re like, you know, I need everything
I can get. And they see it as a positive, which I find very interesting. But what I would say is, I
like to differentiate between clinical and clean. So if you&#39;re going to choose something every
day, just think of your body burden. Because every day you&#39;re using these same products. So
choose clean skincare. Ideally, I like to flip it [the packaging] over and say, okay, do I understand
what these ingredients are? And if there&#39;s anything that ends with a paraben, definitely don&#39;t
include that. And then if you feel like you need something particularly, that I would call clinical,
like some people go to do a face peel at a spa, so separate that as something that you do
maybe rarely, but you do it for a specific reason. And then very much you can focus on clean
skincare every day.
David Stouder: Well, that&#39;s a very reasonable, and I think an easy-to-follow definition because
there&#39;s no sort of zero toxin life. But I always say when you have a choice, make a good
decision. So if you&#39;re going to buy skincare products, especially like you said, the ones you&#39;re
going to use every day.

Now, my general assessment has been, if you go into the drug stores, most of that stuff is
mostly chemicals. And some of your salon products have a pretty high percentage of good
ingredients, but they still have 10, 20% chemicals.
Now, if you go into a good health food store, you&#39;re going to get the cleaner kinds of products.
Not necessarily 100%, but I look at the labels and there&#39;s still a lot of words I don&#39;t know. When
I found out, when I first met you and we started doing these podcasts, I did not know you had a
skincare line right away. So I went over and looked at it. Now, I&#39;ve looked at skincare products
for the health market for 50 years. I mean, it was just the cleanest I&#39;d ever seen. I think you told
me you could eat them. There&#39;s so many skincare lines out there, but you seem to have really
made the cleanest I&#39;ve ever seen.
Rebekah Kelley: I&#39;ve been working on my skincare line since I was 16. And it wasn&#39;t a &quot;skincare
line.&quot; I was just trying to survive skin that was upset about so many different things. And so
there was really not a lot of options. I&#39;m in my 50s now, so that was decades ago [laughs]. Now
when you go [to the store], I feel like there are a lot of much more viable options that are much
healthier. So it&#39;s a different world now than it used to be and it excites me because it means
that people are paying attention. People are being thoughtful. There are some amazing
creators now that are bringing products to the table that are SO much better for your skin. And
I just find that I think people are getting smarter, paying more attention, being more careful.
Just like we were watching what goes IN our body, hopefully now we&#39;re starting to watch what
goes ON our body. But when you look at what goes on your body, you want to make sure that it
is organic. That it&#39;s something that you can read [on the label]. Something that it... I say never
put anything on your skin you can&#39;t eat. That&#39;s MY comfort level. So I think that, while there are
so many, more and more skincare lines out there... the Environmental Working group does a
great job of this. It&#39;s an app or it&#39;s also a website. Anyone who actually has some products and
they want to double check them, they&#39;re not really sure, go in and they&#39;ve got a great list. You
can plug in what that particular product is, and most likely they have it in their database. Now,
some of the more boutique products like mine, we&#39;re not in it because we&#39;re smaller, but if you
can flip it over and you recognize every ingredient, you know you can eat every ingredient, you
know it&#39;s pretty clean.
David Stouder: Well, exactly. Now, I would say a fair amount of people, sort of one of the
reasons they do clinical things is they want to go to the bottom line; I want to get rid of my
wrinkles, maybe I care if it&#39;s really clean, maybe I don&#39;t. But obviously you had great success
cause, as I said, and it&#39;s true, you have great skin. So the way you eat and treat your skin and
your products are obviously doing you well. You have to get feedback from your customers. You
got a couple of good stories to tell us?
Rebekah Kelley: I do, but I did just want to mention something since you brought up the fact
that people, you know what I had said that they really wanted the chemicals. The thing is, is
that a lot of people don&#39;t realize, but you know, just because a marketer – and being a marketer
myself, right? – just because there&#39;s a claim made, it doesn&#39;t always mean that that is actually

accurate, right? [Laughs] So I just want to put out there that the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act
has not been updated since it passed in 1938. So a lot of statements that are made, they
actually... the FDA assumes that companies are self-regulated. So, you know, people can kind of
put a spin on things. So it&#39;s not necessarily always the most accurate. So while I certainly
understand that someone believes what someone has to say, remember that, I just want to
remind everyone, this is a $60 billion personal care product industry. It&#39;s to make money. And
so one of the things you really want to do is be aware of that, right? So when someone says
something&#39;s going to prevent you from wrinkles, wrinkles are a natural part of living life. And
the healthier and more vibrant you are, you can actually see it. You see people who are
glowing, you know they&#39;re healthy and vibrant. So, I just want to remind people, just because it
says anti-wrinkle [laughs] does not necessarily mean that&#39;s what it does.
And matter of fact, they&#39;re doing so many studies now, which I&#39;m really excited about. They&#39;re
doing so many studies now. And actually, there was a study that came out with, actually I just
pulled it. [Referring to notes] The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists wrote in
a 2013 report, that there is robust evidence linking toxic environmental agents to adverse
reproductive and developmental health outcomes. So, while I think it&#39;s wonderful to want to be
beautiful and look fabulous, and certainly we don&#39;t want to embrace wrinkles earlier than we
need to, although a lot of times it is a rite of passage and a beautiful part of being on this world,
we do want to really be thoughtful about our reproductive and developmental health. And
when that&#39;s what&#39;s impacting it, it&#39;s something to really be aware of. There&#39;s a lot of studies out
there now that really point to the fact that we want to be super, super thoughtful about our
skincare and make sure that it&#39;s as clean as possible.
And the other thing that I did want to mention is that Dr. [Michael] Murray and Dr. [Joseph]
Pizzorno have both been on other [Humanized] podcasts talking about getting plastics out of
our diet. And I think the other thing that I hate to flag and make it more complicated, but a lot
of skincare comes in plastics. So even if you&#39;re getting great skincare, but it&#39;s in plastic, it&#39;s
absorbing those things as synthetic compounds and you&#39;re putting it on your skin, you&#39;re also
absorbing it that way too. So look for something that&#39;s in glass, ideally, that&#39;s not necessarily
absorbing plastic.
But anyway, do I get feedback from people? Yes, I do. Matter of fact, it&#39;s one of my favorite
things, is hearing from others about how actually they&#39;ve been able to heal their skin by using it
as a support and giving their skin nutrition. And matter of fact, that&#39;s actually how I ended up
starting making skincare for other people besides me. I actually started making it for my
girlfriends and I would give it to them because I was so happy by the concept of them not taking
on an additional toxic burden that I used to go and do little drop-offs and deliver to different
girlfriends. And finally, someone, actually my girlfriend said to me, you can&#39;t keep doing this.
You&#39;ve got to start charging us. And I was like, really? And she&#39;s like, yes, Rebekah, this costs
money. It is actually very expensive. It&#39;s all organic. It&#39;s all natural. There&#39;s no water in my
skincare products, so it&#39;s super nutritious. So it is very pricey to make [laughs]. And so when she
said that, I started making it more thoughtfully because I&#39;d be like, wait, I&#39;ve got to think about

this. I&#39;ve got to put it in this kind of container. How do you use it? Before, I would just glop it on
sometimes, because I didn&#39;t really care. It was just getting something on my skin that was going
to care for me. Then I started thinking about how other people were going to be using it, what
the experience was, and it just got to a whole other level. And then now, I&#39;m at Village Green
Apothecary, I&#39;m in some hotels and spas, and it&#39;s just been wonderful then to see it being used
and embraced as a way for people to support their health and wellness. Which is really what&#39;s
important to me. So I encourage people, go look in the Environmental Working Group&#39;s
website, look at your products and then go choose something that&#39;s really good and healthy
and sustaining for you and for your family.
David Stouder: That is well said. And I want to remind everybody listening. Know, when you
walk into a store, let&#39;s say like Village Green Apothecary, you look at all of their supplements,
you look at all the skincare. If you&#39;ve heard what Rebekah has said in this podcast, and that&#39;s
the kind of person I want constructing my skincare products, somebody with her values, her
attention to detail. So, I want to remind you, you can find Rebekah at www.VirtueSkinfood –

Dr. Sheila Kilbane
Rebekah Kelley: Welcome to the Humanized Podcast, all about personalizing your
health. I&#39;m your host, Rebekah Kelley. Today I&#39;m excited to have Dr. Sheila Kilbane with
us. But before I introduce Dr. Kilbane, I want to remind everyone to subscribe, to get all
of our variety of casts in audio, video and transcription at HumanizedHealth.com. I&#39;d
also like to thank our lead sponsor, Village Green Apothecary at MyVillageGreen.com.
Dr. Kilbane, I&#39;m so excited to have you here talking about the common thread among
the top eight pediatric illnesses.
Sheila Kilbane: Thank you so much for having me. I&#39;m super excited. I can talk about
kids&#39; health all day long. So, I&#39;ll tell you a little bit about myself and then I&#39;ll talk about my
new book.
I am a board certified pediatrician. I did extra training in integrative medicine with
Andrew Weil through the University of Arizona. I have a private practice in Charlotte,
North Carolina, and all I do is integrative medicine.
I see kids all day long who have been treated through conventional medicine, but
they&#39;re still struggling. They come here and we look at food, we look at the gut
microbiome, we use supplements and herbs, and mind- body therapies to optimize their
systems.
It&#39;s an individualized approach, and it&#39;s so much fun because we get to see huge
transformations and not only for the kids. When I work with a family, I always
recommend that they do everything together; and you see great transformations in
parents. I just got a call a couple of weeks ago from the dad of one of the kids we&#39;re
working with. He had been trying to lose weight for 4 years and had done all kinds of
different things. He&#39;s a big weightlifter. When he implemented the nutritional changes
we recommended for his daughter, he lost 10 pounds. Those are some of my most fun
things, when parents also have these really great shifts.
My new book is called Healthy Kids, Happy Moms. It is about seven steps to heal and
prevent common childhood illnesses.

When I first got out of residency, I was prescribing antacids, antibiotics and steroids
month after month. It was always the same kids coming into the office and having these
recurrent illnesses. I&#39;m not somebody who will continue to do the same thing over and
over. So I kept asking myself, what is going on here? Why are these things happening?
You do a steroid and the kids get better for 2 weeks; then they&#39;re sick again in 2 weeks.
And same thing with recurrent ear infections; we&#39;ll do an antibiotic and they&#39;ll get better.
And then that chronic runny nose comes right back, and a couple months later we&#39;re
having to do another antibiotic. So I realized that there is a common thread because it&#39;s
reflux, eczema, recurrent ear and sinus infections, chronic runny nose, allergies,
asthma, abdominal pain, constipation, or loose stools. I&#39;m a good listener; I would hear
breastfeeding moms say that they changed their diets a little bit and their babies’
eczema would improve, or the child&#39;s ear infections would start to improve.
And so, it&#39;s comical to me now, but I didn&#39;t realize what was happening. But it&#39;s all about
inflammation. One common thread in particular was dairy, which can be quite inflaming
for many people. It may contribute to a chronic runny nose, to eczema, to bumps on the
back of the arms. Kids might even have dark circles under their eyes. We would remove
dairy and not only would the eczema improve, but also the chronic runny nose, or
recurrent ear or sinus infections would improve.
So I continued to study and really look at these things. And it&#39;s all about inflammation,
especially right now in our world. We&#39;ve got a pandemic happening. We have viruses –
we know about the repercussions from viruses. It&#39;s not always the virus itself, but it is
the inflammation that gets triggered from the virus that is the problem. So we&#39;re walking
around with all of this excess systemic inflammation, our cup of inflammation is really
quite full. And then if we can go through and just lessen some of those inflammatory
issues, we bring that cup down. When we get exposed to that virus, we&#39;re not going to
get nearly as sick as we would have previously.

To bring this into a perspective, this was a little boy who came to me. You can see a big
difference between the two photos. You see how he&#39;s got pale skin and dark circles
under his eyes? He doesn&#39;t really even have a clear look in his eyes. He&#39;s not
necessarily really looking at the camera. Then this is him on the right, at least a year
later, a better school photographer probably. You see how his skin has that really great
coloring. He no longer has dark circles under his eyes, and he&#39;s just got a focused, clear
look. This little boy now is in college and he got a full ride scholarship.
At the time of the photo on the left, with that paleness, he had tics and they were so bad
that he pulled a muscle in his neck. So what we did was we gradually went through and
shifted the nutrition. We looked at the nutrients and shifted them; for him, actually, dairy
wasn&#39;t the big issue, but gluten was. We took that out of his diet and that allowed his
systemic inflammation to decrease. Then he was able to absorb his nutrients more
effectively and efficiently from his food. It took time and it was gradual, but then he came
to this really beautiful ability to absorb what he was eating. And so I love his picture
because it is worth a thousand words.
And I&#39;ve seen this hundreds of times. It can be asthma, chronic abdominal pain, severe
constipation, or loose stool. It just happened to be tics in him, but it can be all of those
different common threads.
I like to make things as simple as possible. When we look at this inflammation, we want
to ask what is triggering it.
There are five main triggers. We always have our genetics. It is the way our genetics
interplay with food, environmental allergies, environmental toxins, infectious diseases
and stress.

Stress can be physical and it can be emotional. Physical can be, you fractured an ankle
or you have scoliosis.
Under infectious diseases, we have our acute illnesses. But also, in functional,
integrative, and personalized medicine, we talk a lot about the microbiome and that&#39;s
what we&#39;re looking at. We do stool studies to identify what&#39;s going on with the
microorganisms in the GI tract. That&#39;s a whole other discussion that we&#39;ll talk about on
another podcast.
With regard to environmental toxins, we just want to make sure that we’re breathing in
clean air and drinking clean water. We want to make sure we don&#39;t have any mold, any
water damage in our homes.
And with environmental allergens, that&#39;s something you can review with your primary
care doctor or an allergist. They can check you for allergies.
And then food. Food is where I&#39;m going to give you some good, simple tips to start with
today. I talked about dairy and gluten with that little boy, but we don&#39;t have to do that
yet. That&#39;s a much later step. We&#39;ll talk about some much more simple things that you
can do starting today with your families to start to decrease systemic inflammation.
To give you another little visual, we&#39;ve got the cup of inflammation on the left; when that
cup is overflowing, we have symptoms. That&#39;s when we get the litany of illnesses and
symptoms that come with all of that inflammation.
Leaky gut is another term that many of you may have heard. It&#39;s when we eat a lot of
junk food, artificial dyes and colors, and maybe take some medications, like antacids or
steroids, and they contribute to inflammation along the GI tract. This will also hinder our
ability to digest and absorb nutrients. So again, what we&#39;re working toward is decreasing
that inflammation. Then we lessen all of those symptoms. We get deeper, better sleep,
less congestion, less runny nose.

I want to solidify the point. I want to give you another case example. This was a case of
a little boy. He was about 6 when I first met him and his mother. He had wheezing and
recurrent sinus infections. When you get wheezy you have to take albuterol, which
helps decrease wheezing in the lungs. When we went through his triggers of
inflammation, he had a significant dust mite allergy, and a sensitivity to dairy. And I
knew he had a sensitivity to dairy based on his history. He had had a lot of reflux and
feeding issues as an infant. He had dark circles under his eyes and he was a mouth
breather.
He was sort of a Darth Vader breather; he was sitting on the exam table and I could hear
him breathing. And so we took dairy out of his diet. Since he had a dust mite allergy, the
other thing we figured out was that he was sleeping on a mattress that had been his
uncle&#39;s from when his uncle was in college. So that would have had a lot of dust mites.
So we got into the mattress. We took out dairy. And within 2 to 3 weeks, he was a
different child.
I make this case. This is a visual depiction of how, for him, the food in the more inflamed
cup was taking up a lot of space with the dairy, because that was inflaming him, and
then his environmental allergies with the dust mites.
Just by decreasing those, we decreased his symptoms enough that he didn&#39;t have to
continue to use the albuterol and he went on antibiotics very rarely. We were able to
head off the course of his illness without a ton of intervention.

It&#39;s not always easy to change your diet. But when you see the results so clearly, it&#39;s
much easier to keep it up. So that&#39;s what happens with the kids.
Rebekah Kelley: Sheila, does your book allow people to understand the process, what
they need to do and where they need to go? Is that something they&#39;ll be able to use as a
resource? Can they go to your website right now to find out more information? What
would be the next step if people suspect that they actually are having this situation with
their child, they know how to address it?
Sheila Kilbane: They can definitely go to the website at SheilaKilbane.com. We&#39;ll have
all of the resources there. We have an online course and we&#39;re updating that. We go
through things step by step. I&#39;ll also provide you all with the links today, just for our mini-
cleanse. These are some really simple steps that you can start doing. You don&#39;t have to
take dairy or gluten out of the diet, but just start with sugary drinks and do that. You can
do that day one. Day two, we just do a little mini-cleanse for kids. And this is what we
start with so that it&#39;s not overwhelming. Day three, artificial dyes and colors and
packaged snacks. And then day four, five and six we decreased refined, decreasing
processed meats, things like hotdogs.
Rebekah Kelley: This is all available online, so they can actually go and visit?
Sheila Kilbane: Yup. And we have a link. We do have a little mini-cleanse that parents
can sign up for. And then this will get emailed right to your inbox and walk through this.
Rebekah Kelley: Thank you so much Dr. Kilbane. Those are valuable insights. More

David Stouder: Welcome to the Humanized podcast. It&#39;s all about personalizing your
health. I&#39;m your host, Dave Stouder. Now today we&#39;ll be discussing An Integrative
Approach to Improving Eczema, with Dr. Sheila Kilbane. And before I introduce Dr.
Kilbane, I do want to remind you that you can subscribe and get all of the variety of
casts – we&#39;ve got videos, audios, transcriptions – at HumanizedHealth.com. I would
like to thank our lead sponsor, Village Green Apothecary, and you can visit Village
Green Apothecary at MyVillageGreen.com.
Now a little bit about, Dr. Kilbane. She&#39;s a board certified pediatrician, specializes in
integrative medicine. Boy, I wish there were more of you around, Dr. Kilbane. She
uses the best of traditional integrative medicine to find the root cause of illness.
Using her 7-step process along with natural and nutritional therapies, Dr. Kilbane
helps families significantly improve or resolve altogether illnesses such as colic,
reflux, eczema, recurrent ear and sinus infections, asthma, allergies, and stomach
and GI issues such as constipation and abdominal pain. She also conducts online
classes in addition to seeing individual patients in Charlotte, North Carolina. She&#39;s
written a wonderful book, which you&#39;re seeing up on the screen [Healthy Kids, Happy
Moms] and there&#39;s her website there [SheilaKilbane.com/eczema/], but we&#39;ll make
sure we announce it at the end of the podcast.
Now Dr. Kilbane, we had you on before, and this is such an important topic because,
you know, I&#39;m a parent and it&#39;s one thing when you&#39;re dealing with adults with
health issues, they can talk to you, they can tell you how bad it is. And it&#39;s so
frustrating sometimes with your children, and we want to give them help, and we
run to the doctor and they&#39;re just not necessarily, you know, doing things. So, why
don&#39;t you just get in and sort of give us a background of eczema and the triggers and
some of the key things we can do about it.
Sheila Kilbane: Yeah, absolutely. Thank you so much, David. And thank you to the
Apothecary for hosting this.
So, I wanted to talk about eczema because it&#39;s such a huge issue. 30 million
Americans have eczema, and it&#39;s very common. We get lots and lots of calls, lots of
patients with it. And I&#39;m going to go through, I&#39;m calling this a jumpstart because the
full approach is very comprehensive, integrative medicine is always comprehensive.
And so I&#39;m just going to break it down and I&#39;m going to give you some snippets
today, some very actionable things to do if you or your child has eczema. And I also
don&#39;t want you to worry about taking notes because I have this in a beautiful PDF
that you can go to my website and download. So don&#39;t worry about madly taking
notes. It&#39;s just at SheilaKilbane.com-backslash-eczema.

And before we jump into eczema, I am going to go through, I&#39;m just going to give a
brief recap of our first podcast with you. And we talked about the common thread of
the top eight pediatric illnesses. So it&#39;s reflux, eczema, recurrent ear and sinus
infections, chronic runny nose, allergies, asthma, abdominal pain, constipation and
loose stools. And in integrative medicine, we trained to look at the common
inflammation among symptoms. And so we&#39;re going to dig deep into eczema today.
And before we get into it, though: inflammation. So, we talked previously.
Inflammation. When we have chronic excess inflammation, that&#39;s when we have
symptoms. So when we have that cup that&#39;s all full of inflammation, that&#39;s when we
have a flare of eczema or runny nose, maybe we&#39;re mouth breathing, maybe
wheezing. And when we take each different aspect of our environment, our food –
and I&#39;m going to go through that – and we decrease that inflammation, and then
symptoms decrease. So it&#39;s rarely about one magic bullet. It&#39;s usually the whole
picture.
And this is an image [on the screen] – and this image is from my book – and I list out
all the things. When you have that really big cup of inflammation, right, you can have
sleep disturbances, trouble focusing, emotional distress, meltdowns, nasal
congestion. I&#39;m not going to read through all of these, but they all are tied together.
And then when we decrease that systemic inflammation, it doesn&#39;t mean absolutely
everything&#39;s going to go away, but it generally means we&#39;re going to have a decrease
in symptoms.
And when we&#39;re talking about triggers, that inflammation is illness, now we go
through the triggers of inflammation. So we always have our genetics, and I always
break down the five triggers of inflammation. So it&#39;s the way that our genetics
interact with our food, environmental allergies, environmental toxins, infectious
diseases, and stress – and stress can be physical and emotional – and all of these
weigh equally into inflammation.
And when it comes to eczema, today we&#39;re going to mainly focus on the food
triggers. We&#39;re going to talk about the gut microbiome. And then the skin
microbiome is another very big topic when it comes to eczema – we&#39;ll talk about that
on the next podcast.
Is all this making sense so far, David?
David Stouder: Absolutely. I think this is what parents want to hear because even we
can rub cortisone cream on something on the skin and get a little relief from a
symptom, but it&#39;s WHY my baby or a child, or why I have eczema. And so this is what
people need to hear, is getting at changing the pattern, the inflammatory pattern so
you don&#39;t have this problem.

Sheila Kilbane: Exactly, exactly. And with eczema, we will often in integrative and
functional medicine, talk about healing the skin from the inside out, and it&#39;s actually
a two-way street. So if we don&#39;t address the skin as well, that can continue to trigger
a leaky gut. So that&#39;s where the whole skin microbiome is a really important part of
this, typically when it&#39;s more severe eczema. When it&#39;s mild to moderate, usually the
strategies that I&#39;m going to share with you today should really help to make a pretty
significant difference if food is one of the triggers.
So, this is a case of one of my patients. This was early on, out of residency. I was a
new doctor, didn&#39;t have any idea that there was a connection with our health and
food, which speaks to the way that we... we don&#39;t get much nutrition training, or
any, really, in medical school when I trained. So now it&#39;s starting to change, which is
good. So Johnny was, I&#39;d been seeing him since he was born, and he started, 3, 4
months of age, started getting eczema, was getting recurrent ear infections, we were
having to do rounds of antibiotics. And around when he was about 9 months old,
mom came in for his well visit and said, you know, Dr. Kilbane, I took dairy out of my
diet – she was breastfeeding him – and his eczema improved. Now it didn&#39;t fully go
away. And he had had enough ear infections that I had to refer him to get ear tubes.
So, a couple of months go by, there&#39;s an insurance glitch, she doesn&#39;t go in to get the
ear tubes – and mom was hesitant to get the ear tubes anyway, she just didn&#39;t want
to have to put him on general anesthesia. So it gets to be his year visit and he still
hasn&#39;t had the ear tube surgery. So the day before his 1-year well-check, mom had a
big omelet, which has a lot of egg – and she still had dairy out of his diet, so it was
just a big egg omelet. He had a huge eczema flare. So we knew dairy was a culprit, as
well as egg. And what the research shows us is that about a third of eczema can be
triggered by food allergies or food sensitivities and dairy and eggs are the two big
culprits.
So I was seeing these things in real time. And then after the fact I was going in and
reading about it and understanding, okay, we do have research on this. So we kept
dairy and eggs out of his diet. And the interesting part is when we took eggs out of
his diet, the fluid in his ears cleared up and he never had to get ear tube surgery. And
there&#39;s a lot of variables there, right? He was getting older, the eustachian tubes
when we&#39;re born, they&#39;re more horizontal and then they get more vertical so they
drain better, but he still was just over a year of age. So I do think it was the systemic
decrease of inflammation that helped him.
David Stouder: Makes sense.
Sheila Kilbane: Makes sense, right? So, I have this big list of all these foods and I just
list these out, so these 11 foods cause 90% of our food allergies and food
sensitivities. [Dairy, wheat, eggs, corn, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, citric
acid, sesame.] So it doesn&#39;t mean that all of these foods are unhealthy or that you

have to go off of all of them. I list these out because for some kids and adults, it
might be dairy and eggs that are the trigger. For some people, it might be wheat or
corn or soy. So I just like you to be aware and you can start really paying attention to
when you eat something and what&#39;s happening with the skin or with the bowels or
with your sleep. So it helps to know this.
And with Johnny, if we relate it back to that cup of inflammation, so his main
things... so he had a little bit of stress, right? Because his body, if you&#39;re sick and
you&#39;ve got inflammation, you&#39;ve got some stress. And infectious diseases – he was
getting recurrent ear infections. But his biggest part of his inflammation was the
food. So taking out the dairy and eggs, we decreased his cup of inflammation and he
did much better after that. And so for moms who are breastfeeding, they would take
it out of their diet. And then as the babies start to eat more food, you keep it out of
the child&#39;s diet.
And eczema, it&#39;s just on the rise. Significantly. So in 1946, we had 5% of the
population had eczema; 1958, 7%; 1970s, 12%. And in some areas of the U.S., it&#39;s up
to 30% and it&#39;s a really big issue. We learn in medical school how to use steroids. So
we use topical steroids to decrease the inflammation. And what we do in integrative
medicine is we use both – we use steroids if we need to, but we also decrease that
inflammation on the inside so that we can get that long lasting, so that we pull the
steroids, we don&#39;t continue to have the eczema. And we spent a lot of money on it,
3.8 billion dollars.
David Stouder: Wow.
Sheila Kilbane: Right? So that&#39;s the food portion of it. And I&#39;m going to talk about the
microbiome. This was a patient who came to see me, 18 months old, and they came
for the eczema, but they also came for his meltdowns. This little boy had such severe
meltdowns. This family had never been out to eat because he would scream, he
would throw himself on the floor. And they had already made a lot of nutrition
changes. And so we didn&#39;t have to, he was already off of dairy. He had been off of
gluten, they&#39;d added it back in. But dairy was definitely one of his triggers. But
between these two pictures [of the little boy&#39;s eczema], the only thing different was
the addition of a probiotic. And that just speaks volumes to how we want to get the
gut microbiome... So we have more bacteria in the gut than we have cells in the
body and they play a significant role in our overall health, our inflammation and the
way we digest and absorb nutrients. So these parents always, they give me these
photos because they know I do a lot of talks and they want other families to
understand that.
So, what I want to do is give you... This is the way that I proceed with parents and
families in my practice. So we gradually remove dairy and I like to only make one

food change at a time. So I usually will just take dairy out. We do it over 3 weeks
because dairy, it&#39;s so inflaming and it actually has, it&#39;s called an opiate-like effect. So
kids can go through what looks like a withdrawal. Have you seen that or read about
that?
David Stouder: Briefly, I had a woman who worked in a jail and she had a gentleman
who got terrible, terrible stomach pains and only milk would soothe his pains – but
she realized the milk was causing it. It was soothing it immediately, but causing it.
And it took her a long time, but once she got him to stop using milk, his pains went
away.
Sheila Kilbane: Yes. That is it exactly. Exactly. And I learned this the hard way. You
know, I would have families, when I first started doing this I would have them go off
dairy cold turkey. Moms would call me back a few days later and they&#39;d say, you
know, Dr. Kilbane, Johnny is going berserk. I&#39;d say, I&#39;m sorry, we&#39;re on the right track.
Keep it out. So at first we do it out of breakfast for the first week, lunch at the
second week, dinner and snacks the third week, and then you leave it out for at least
3 to 4 weeks to see if you notice the difference.
Typically once it&#39;s fully out, you&#39;ll notice the improvement within a week or two. And
while we&#39;re removing the dairy, we&#39;re going to add in our probiotic for that first
week, and then our digestive enzymes for the second week. And then after you do
that, if the skin is still flared, then you can remove eggs. But I like to do these two
things first.
And then when it comes to the gut microbiome, I use more supplements than this in
my practice for kids with eczema, but I wanted to keep it really simple for the
purposes here. And these two are the powerhouses of the supplements I use in my
practice.
So this probiotic, you do it at the start of breakfast and the start of dinner and the
same thing with the digestive enzyme. It&#39;s a plant-based digestive enzyme at the
start of breakfast, at the start of dinner. And once you get on these and the kids are
off of dairy and they&#39;re doing well, we want to do this for 3 to 6 months before
adding the dairy back in, because we want to give... Think about healing the gut like
we&#39;re healing a sprained ankle. It can take a good 3 to 6 months for that ankle joint
to feel like your own joint again. So we want to give the gut a really good amount of
time to heal. Does that make sense? You know, because that inflammation, like red,
inflamed, pain, mucus, just think about that along the GI tract.
David Stouder: Well, it makes all the sense in the world, Dr. Kilbane. I think
sometimes people, like when we have a symptom and we&#39;re used to sometimes
medication, you know, we rub the steroid cream on and it goes away. But I like your

analogy of a sprained ankle because it often takes us awhile to get to a problem. And
I think what&#39;s good is, as long as we see we&#39;re moving in the right direction, then we
should feel good, and if we stay on the right path, then we get to a complete healing.
Sheila Kilbane: Exactly, exactly. And for some people, if it&#39;s a really big improvement
off of the dairy or the eggs, it may need to be a lifestyle, right? You may not be able
to add that food back in, or you might be able to do it at special occasions. And that&#39;s
always my goal in my practice. I don&#39;t like to restrict kids, what they eat. I like to
keep a wide variety of food, if at all possible. So if we need to, though, sometimes
we have to make it a lifestyle shift.
And so here again, in the download, I&#39;ve got what to remove and replace with. And
in my book, I comb through all of the, how we&#39;re going to make sure that the kids
have healthy bones if we need to keep dairy out for any length of time, so that we&#39;re
still getting calcium. So I cover all of that.
And so just in summary, food triggers with eczema, the two big culprits, about a third
of eczema, dairy and eggs can be the two big culprits. But it can be other foods, as
well. And then with the gut microbiome, we&#39;re going to do a probiotic and a
digestive enzyme.
And then at the next one, we will talk about the skin microbiome, and I just showed
a before and after picture of one of my little patients. He definitely needed our
topical. He had a bacteria on his skin that needed to be treated with, we used an
antibiotic, a topical antibiotic, and then an emollient. [Inaudible segment.] They
decided to create a summit. And that summit is coming up at the end of August –
this [her PowerPoint presentation] is saying the encore weekend, but it&#39;s the last
week of August of 2021. And, and if you go to SheilaKilbane.com-backslash-eczema,
you can get my jumpstart guide and then we&#39;ll have the link there for you to sign up
if you want to join the summit. It should be really good. And they&#39;re doing it as a
masterclass, so it&#39;s going to be very &quot;how to&quot; versus having a lot of different experts
speak on different topics. It&#39;s going to be very focused and it&#39;ll be really great.
David Stouder: Well, this sounds good. Let me encourage everybody, if you&#39;re
watching this podcast, maybe eczema is your issue or your child&#39;s issue, but if you
know someone who needs this information, please refer them to the podcast. And I
want to thank Dr. Kilbane for being with us today. And I&#39;ll remind you to go subscribe

A little bit about Dr. Sheila Kilbane. She&#39;s a board certified pediatrician who specializes in
integrative medicine. She uses the best of traditional and integrative medicine to find the root
cause of illness. Using her seven-step process along with natural and nutritional therapies, Dr.
Kilbane helps families significantly improve or resolve altogether illnesses such as colic, reflux,
eczema, recurrent ear and sinus infections, asthma, allergies, and stomach and GI issues such as
constipation and abdominal pain. She also conducts online educational classes, in addition to
seeing individual patients in Charlotte, North Carolina.
So great to have you. Thank you so much for being here with us. It&#39;s always fun.
Sheila Kilbane: Thank you, Rebekah. I always love chatting with you.
Rebekah Kelley: So, I just want to jump right in. Obviously, as we&#39;re looking at winter ahead,
having healthy immunity is on everyone&#39;s mind, especially in the current situation that we&#39;ve
been in, some of us being &quot;on lockdown.&quot; What are some key personalized strategies that
parents can be doing to winterize their child? What is the foundation that you recommend they
start working on?
Sheila Kilbane: Yes. And I love that terminology when I thought about it because I want
people... We all spend a great deal of time and effort in keeping our automobiles moving, with
the right oil and all that kind of thing. So I want us to start thinking about our kids and our
health the same way that we would take care of our car, or that we would plan a trip. So I want
you to start thinking about the winter this way. And when we talk about… I always call it the
foundation. We have our foundational piece in our foundational supplements, and then
sometimes we need to add in other supplements as maybe acute viral support, things like that.
We can talk a little bit about that.
But today I wanted to really focus on those foundations. That&#39;s what&#39;s going to allow us to
respond better when we get exposed to a virus or maybe the bacteria that causes strep throat
or things like that, because we can get exposed to things, but it doesn&#39;t always mean we&#39;re
going to end up sick. And our immune systems are incredible and beautifully designed to take
care of these things.

So the first thing that I want to talk about is digestion. And when we&#39;re setting the foundation
for digestion, most people know that we&#39;ve got a lot of microorganisms in our GI system. We&#39;ve
got some bacteria, there may be some yeast, there are different microorganisms. I think about
it like the soil of our body. And so we want to fuel that bacteria, we want to feed it with the
right kind of foods. And that&#39;s where we talk about fiber – fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, things
like that. And I want to give you a little statistic here about this. So – 93% of kids don&#39;t eat
enough vegetables, and 60% don&#39;t eat enough fruits. So if you&#39;re going to do anything, add one
extra vegetable and one extra fruit to your kids’ meals daily. And a great way to do that is
through a green smoothie. So you can do that in the morning.
That being said, this is how I also really talk to parents about why we do need supplements,
because kids are not eating the foods that we need. I wish we could do it without supplements,
but we live in a very fast-paced world and we&#39;re often having food out of a package or at a
drive-through. And that isn&#39;t the type of food that&#39;s going to sustain us and to create really
healthy cells.
So the first thing that we do is we add in a probiotic. And you don&#39;t need to take notes for this.
I&#39;ve got a free download where you can see all the supplements that I use, and dosing and
everything. And it&#39;s just SheilaKilbane.com/SupplementGuide. So we do a probiotic and I have
the family start it at the start of breakfast and dinner, and then we add in a digestive enzyme.
Digestion can be compromised through a lot of different things – as we age, if we are taking
medications, if we&#39;re under stress, if we&#39;re sick, so many different things compromise our
digestion. So we just... it&#39;s a really nice, powerful, plant-based digestive enzyme. And for the
kids, there&#39;s a powder, there&#39;s a chewable, there&#39;s a capsule, whatever works for your family.
And you would do that along with the probiotic at the start of breakfast and dinner. So this is
great, we&#39;ve got a good solid digestion.
And then we talk about omega-3 fats and those are the anti-inflammatory fats, and we want to
really focus on those. We&#39;ve got our digestion set. Then we really focus on the omega-3 fats
because if we&#39;re doing, if we&#39;re adding maybe coldwater fish, like sockeye salmon to the diet,
we want to make sure that fat is getting broken down and absorbed. Hence the enzymes. So
you can do that, or you can do it with a fish oil, or there are some plant-based sources of
omega-3 fats. And some of the food plant-based sources are going to be things like chia seed,
flax seed, hemp seed, which are phenomenal, but they&#39;re not often... kids aren&#39;t eating a lot of
those. So you can throw those in smoothies. You can make little puddings and things.
And then the next supplement is vitamin D. And vitamin D is the end-all, right? This is the
biggie. We know it is really a huge part of our immune system. It&#39;s actually more like a hormone
than it is a vitamin, and we&#39;ve got a vitamin D receptor on almost every cell of our body. And
we&#39;re in a pandemic with viruses, different things. We know that optimizing our vitamin D
levels, it&#39;s one of the most important things we can do. And one of the ladies in my office jokes,
she&#39;s like, I think we should make people show their vitamin D levels, like when you&#39;re going to
travel or do something because that&#39;s how important it is.

Rebekah Kelley: [Laughs] It makes sense, yes.
Sheila Kilbane: Right? And so with vitamin D, we get it naturally through sunshine and then it
gets converted and it goes through the liver and it adds a hydroxyl group. And then it goes to
the kidney and we add another hydroxyl group. But when we have sunscreen on, we don&#39;t
synthesize vitamin D, or if it&#39;s the middle of the wintertime. And you know, if you&#39;re a
significant distance above or below the equator, we need to take a supplement in the
wintertime. But not in the summer. I always stop vitamin D in the summer because we want to
get it naturally, but we don&#39;t want to burn, right? So we want to be careful. So we do that.
And then the last thing we add is a whole food supplement or a multivitamin mineral. And I
love whole food supplements because that&#39;s going to give us, it&#39;s going to be made from fruits
and vegetables. And it&#39;s just going to be put into either a capsule or a chewable or some
different forms. Or if you can&#39;t do that, then we would do a good multivitamin/mineral. And I&#39;ve
listed several brands that I have researched, in my handout. So you can look through those. I&#39;ve
got ones from the more expensive to the less expensive and easier to get.
And once we have that really good foundation set, then we start to look at other things like
zinc, right? Zinc is very closely tied in with our immune system. It&#39;s important for wound healing
and it&#39;s important for, just our cellular function. An interesting little factoid is that zinc, in
developing countries, in kids with diarrhea, zinc is one of the first lines of treatment. It&#39;s just
very, very important. And so that&#39;s one of the things, but we don&#39;t want to just do a whole
bunch of zinc for a long period of time because zinc and copper, they are in balance with one
another. So we want to get what we need. And when I&#39;m replacing zinc with kids, I&#39;m checking
their levels. So I know how much I can give them for how long a period of time. But most of the
supplements that you would get over-the-counter are going to be a safe amount.
Then another thing is vitamin C. And vitamin C is antioxidant, it&#39;s going to very much support
the immune system. It also can help with things like allergies. It stabilizes mast cells, which are
what house histamine, which is what creates all the congestion and cough and everything like
that.
And then I also use a supplement that is an immunoglobulin. So everybody knows colostrum,
right? And it&#39;s the immunoglobulins that are in breast milk that help keep babies healthy while
their immune systems are developing. So I use a form of an immunoglobulin for my company
and it&#39;s non-dairy based. So many of my patients are sensitive or allergic to dairy, and this is
another way that it supports... it binds with viruses and bacteria in the gut and helps to
decrease them. So that&#39;s another thing that we use.
And we will use a couple of other things. Quercetin can be helpful. And elderberry syrup can be
helpful. I use elderberry in short courses at a time because it does activate the immune system,

and if you have auto-immune conditions, you don&#39;t want to do that every day for a long period
of time.
So those are the main ones that I use. But Rebekah, I want to take a pause because I&#39;ve been
talking here and I just want to make sure that all makes sense.
Rebekah Kelley: It makes complete sense, and I love how you&#39;re structuring it. It really helps to
see... I love how you talk about the foundation. And I was really surprised when you said that
we&#39;re not getting enough vegetables and fruit, and you&#39;re right, they aren&#39;t as portable, right?
That is one of the challenges of that. The smoothie makes so much sense and I love how you
layered it. And I like that you use testing to figure out what&#39;s also going on. I think that that&#39;s
such an important thing for parents to consider. Because every child&#39;s going to have an
individual need, and if you&#39;re testing it, then you really understand what you&#39;re dealing with.
Sheila Kilbane: Yes. And quality supplements are key. I&#39;ve been doing this long enough that I
have used... and I did this before, I really had a strong idea about quality supplements. And I
would check vitamin D levels and replace it. And I know that certain types were not actually
bringing the vitamin D levels up. So that&#39;s why I&#39;m very specific. And I really talk about brands
and quality because if you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing, I really recommend that you don&#39;t
supplement because you can do more harm than good. And supplements can have artificial
dyes and colors and all that kind of stuff.
Rebekah Kelley: Yeah, that&#39;s really great. I love your supplement guide and I love that you offer
it so that they can just download it. That&#39;s wonderful.
Sheila Kilbane: And I&#39;ve also had my book that came out. It&#39;s Healthy Kids, Happy Moms, and
you can get it anywhere books are sold. And I have all of this written out in the book. We&#39;ve got
great images and they&#39;re colorful and it really is such a... We&#39;ve been getting such great
feedback, and from the conventional pediatricians who have really been liking the format of it,
because these are topics that we don&#39;t learn about in our medical school training. We didn&#39;t
when I trained. We didn&#39;t train him about nutrition, we didn&#39;t train about supplements.
Rebekah Kelley: You don&#39;t happen to have one to hold up show?
Sheila Kilbane: I do. I&#39;ve got them all over the place. [Holds up her book] You can get them
anywhere books are sold, whether it&#39;s Amazon or Target or any of those places. And if you go to
my website, we have all the links in there, and we&#39;ve got a lot of free downloads that are nice
companions with the book. Anywhere on the website, we&#39;ve got little things that you can click
on to get to the book link.

Lisa Klein, PT

Rebekah Kelley: Welcome to the Humanized Podcast, all about personalizing your
health. I'm your host, Rebekah Kelley. Today I'm excited to announce our guest, Lisa
Klein. But before I do that, I want to remind you to subscribe to all of our various casts in
audio, video, and transcription at HumanizedHealth.com. I'd also like to thank our lead
sponsor, Village Green Apothecary, at MyVillageGreen.com.
Our guest, Lisa Klein, is the founder and owner of Total Health Physical Therapy, a PT
practice specializing in manual therapy and total body rehabilitation. Lisa has spent the
entirety of her 30 year career pursuing excellence in manual medicine and total
body-mind healing. Lisa, thank you so much for being here. We're so excited to have
you.
Lisa Klein: I'm happy to be here, Rebekah. Thank you.
Rebekah Kelley: The title of this podcast is ""Stress and Trauma: What They Are and
How They Affect Our System as a Whole."" Obviously, right now there's a lot of stress
and trauma going on.
Lisa Klein: Thanks. Yes. When my COO and I were talking about what to do for this
first recording with Humanized Health Podcasts, she immediately said, ""Trauma and
stress!"" I was like, oh, of course, we'll do that!
Rebekah Kelley: What are some common changes in the body when we're
experiencing stress and trauma?
Lisa Klein: Stress and trauma affect our bodies in different ways, depending upon the
person. You're responding to what you see, what you feel, what you watch on the news,
and what you hear. All these sensory inputs are going to be hitting your body, and your
body has to process all that information. If it's hard to process, it can cause your body
stress. So the adrenals will start to load. The adrenals sit on the kidneys, they are like
little hats, and they produce stress hormones.
The more you're seeing, feeling or hearing information that is difficult or challenging, the
more the adrenals will start to load. We see this also in our patients who have had

physical trauma: car accidents, different things that happened to them. Our bodies are
all wired pretty much the same way.
So that will cause some changes. Your body will start to go into a fight or flight
response. It goes into a response to what you're seeing, what you're hearing, what
you're feeling on a day-to-day basis. If that keeps going, for example, maybe for a year
in a pandemic, that can become escalated in your body. Now your body goes into more
of a trauma response.
Our bodies are handled by the nervous system, and the nervous system is fed in many
ways by the endocrine system. The more your body's under stress, the more the
adrenals are loaded, the kidneys are loaded, different organs start to load with the
fight or flight response. Your body then may kick into a freeze response, which is
mediated by the stomach. So prolonged stress that becomes trauma can cause a
cavalcade of problems, including anything from GI issues, nausea, headaches, sleep
issues, focusing, sugar cravings, just you name it. And every system is affected by it.
Rebekah Kelley: That makes so much sense. Thinking back over the last several
months that we've all been going through, my question is, how can stress cause
digestive issues? I've noticed that my stomach is really much more sensitive over the
past few months, my appetite fluctuates frequently, and definitely something is going on
in my GI tract.
Lisa Klein: When your body starts going into that fight or flight response, it's mediated
by what's called the sympathetic nervous system. It's kind of like you're running from a
tiger. And so your body goes into an adrenal butterfly response, the body shunts fluid
away from the organs into the extremities, essentially. You're no longer just digesting.
Digestion is not that important when you're running from a bear, for example.
You know, where we are in time, we think we're so smart. Everybody thinks, especially
in Washington, we're so smart. But our bodies do what they've done for thousands of
years. When you're under stress, your body will go into this paradigm, which is a
change in fluid, change in neurology, change in hormones. It is what it is.
So, in terms of the digestive system, your body will stop focusing on digesting food. It
will also start to lock down what are called the diaphragms, because the vagal nerve
goes through the respiratory diaphragm. So the more stress you're under, the more your
chest will get tight, your diaphragm will get tight, everything will get tight. And the vagal
nerve, which controls digestion, goes through the diaphragm. So the poor little vagel
nerve gets hit eight ways to Sunday when it's under stress. It's loaded, and now it's

impinging on your diaphragm.
Rebekah Kelley: That's exactly what's going on; you described it. I also noticed I seem
to get cranky for no apparent reason. Actually, I really am feeling that, especially lately,
as I think cabin fever has set in. So what happens in my system that allows stress to
cause this?
Lisa Klein: Again, it's the adrenals. When you're under prolonged stress, the organs
that control appetite, mood, temperature, all these things, are loaded. That means they
don't have the resilience that they're supposed to have. When you do something like
drive on the Beltway [I-495 around Washington, DC], which I did for the first time on
Saturday, it's very stressful. I'm like, ""I'm on the Beltway!"" I haven't been on the Beltway
in a year. So things that technically, theoretically, you should be fine with, your system is
just on a high trigger. It's like a guitar string that's really tight because you haven't had a
break. Again, adrenals, organ systems, neurology, blood vessels, everything goes into
this fight or flight, sympathetic nervous system situation. And the next thing you know, if
you're living with your pod, somebody does something. And you start snapping because
you have no resilience.
Rebekah Kelley: Are there differences in the symptoms of physical stress and trauma,
versus emotional stress and trauma?
Lisa Klein: That's a great question. We see patients who are very complicated. We see
a lot of patients with chronic pain and neurological disorders. All of those things will
cause stress on the system. So, theoretically no. Anything that's stressing out or
traumatizing your body will cause the same reaction.
However, it looks different in the body. When somebody comes in and we map the
fascia, we can kind of tell if it's physical, is it emotional, what is it? Because it presents
differently. But overall, no, those things will cause all kinds of stress and trauma to your
body. I had a patient who fell off a ladder and broke her wrist in a very unpleasant way.
And her blood pressure shot up because it was very painful. So, prolonged physical
pain will also cause the adrenals to load.
Rebekah Kelley: I also notice that I'm having trouble concentrating for periods, actually
it's 30, 45 minutes. I'm really struggling, and that's not like me.
Lisa Klein: I know! It's a lot of people. So again, there's this thing called the
neuro-endocrine connection. It happens with the endocrine connection, which is your
adrenals and the glands in the body: the pituitary, hypothalamus, thyroid. The more the

endocrine system is loaded, it will load the neurological system, and vice versa. So if
you've had neurological trauma, it can affect the glands. And, again, vice versa.
Anybody who's been under prolonged stress can start having a hard time neurologically.
One thing that we see a lot of are attention and concentration issues.
Rebekah Kelley: That's me to a T, and actually most of the friends that I talk to.
Lisa Klein: Yeah. Pretty much all of us right now have the attention spans of like a small
flea. It's really true. That's why we're doing puzzles every night.
Rebekah Kelley: It's so true. Thanks Lisa. Those are really valuable insights. Lisa Klein

Rebekah Kelley: Welcome to the Humanized Podcast, Your Health Personalized. I&#39;m
your host, Rebekah Kelley, and I&#39;m so excited to have Lisa Klein.
But before I invite her onto the program, I want to remind you to subscribe, to get all of
our variety of casts in audio, video and transcription at HumanizedHealth.com. I&#39;d also
like to thank our lead sponsor Village Green Apothecary at MyVillageGreen.com.
Thank you, Lisa, for being on. So happy to have you here.
Lisa Klein: Thank you, Rebekah.
Rebekah Kelley: Our segment is Stress and Trauma: How to Use Manual Medicine to
Help Individuals Process the Effects of Stress and Trauma. What can I do, myself, to
alleviate issues from emotional stress, like sleeplessness, low concentration and mood
swings, basically all three things that I&#39;m dealing with right now!
Lisa Klein: One of the most interesting things about the body is that it responds to
touch. I&#39;m a physical therapist; my career is trying to figure out how you help free people
from pain. Essentially through that process, a whole world was discovered about how
powerful the hands are when used to touch the body. So thousands of hours of training
and practice later, you can actually use that therapeutically.
What can happen is when you&#39;re feeling stress and trauma, it sets into your body
because it can&#39;t be processed out and can&#39;t leave. In the wild, when animals have
stress and trauma, they shake it off. So you need some way to kind of shake off what
you&#39;re experiencing.
If you think about what we&#39;ve been feeling for the past year, that&#39;s a lot to shake off. We
found you can use the hands to help with that process and do things that work really
well. Every day I have patients tell me how much the processing is helping them. We
call it &quot;processing&quot; because you&#39;re helping your body process.
What you want to do is move some of that accumulated energy information out of the
body. So what individuals can do with their own hands is put one hand across the low
back to access the ureters, which are the tubes that go from the kidneys to the bladder.
The job of the ureter is to drain. So when you put a hand across your low back, and you
can use the back of your hand, you’re &quot;cueing.&quot; You&#39;re saying to the ureters, come on,
we need you to work. So the ureters will drain whatever you tell them to drain. The
other hand will go on different organ systems or parts of your body that are having a
hard time. I know this sounds cuckoo bananas, but it works. It works.
Rebekah Kelley: That&#39;s actually logical. Touch does so much for you. But what you&#39;re
saying is that where you touch is going to make a difference.

Lisa Klein: Yes, and it’s intelligent touch that helps even more. So this is what we give
our patients to do from home.
You put a hand across the back to access the ureters. Again, you can use the back of
your hand if you want to. You&#39;re basically above your butt, in the small of your back.
The other hand will go to the areas that are having a hard time. You hold those
connections for about 20 minutes at a time. You don&#39;t have to do them all one after the
other, because that would be a lot. For example, if you&#39;re finding yourself in a fight or
flight situation, you have one hand across the low back on the ureters; the other hand
goes on the adrenals, which love to be touched. The adrenals love attention. You put a
hand across your mid-back around bra-strap level, so, above the kidneys – one hand
on the adrenals, one hand across the low back, and you&#39;d hold that for about 20
minutes. It can be a little bit hard on your shoulders, so you can take breaks. When you
do that, you should start to feel your body relax a little bit. If you&#39;re having a lot of
stomach issues and digestion, you would...
Rebekah Kelley: Can I do it right now?
Lisa Klein: You can do it right now! I&#39;m holding my phone so I can&#39;t do it with you, but
yeah, go for it.
Another thing, if it&#39;s affecting your stomach, you put a hand on your stomach, which is
under your left, lower ribs, and then the other hand goes across your low back. You can
hold that for 20 minutes. If you&#39;re super cranky, you would put a hand across your
forehead, and then across the low back, that&#39;s a really, really nice one.
It&#39;s fabulous; very relaxing. You may want to get the vagal nerve, which is one of the
main controlling nerves of the body. We often get that at the stomach, but also at the
back of the neck is a great way to access the vagal nerve because that&#39;s where it
comes out of the brainstem, out of the brain, out of the head. So, across the neck.
Our bodies are very malleable. They respond to information. If your body&#39;s being
overwhelmed by what you&#39;re seeing, what you&#39;re hearing, what you’re feeling, what we
do is we use the hands to override that information, to cue all that stuff to get out of
you. Our bodies are neurological; they stay trained. So the more you are experiencing,
seeing, hearing and feeling stress, your body – it&#39;s called &quot;kindling&quot; – your body will
kindle to that level of stress.
The goal is to get it out of that paradigm; the hands are very good for that. There is
acupuncture and many other things that are also helpful. But you have your hands with
you all the time; you have your tools with you. I had someone tell me this morning –
we&#39;re working with him on a dizziness situation – that it is phenomenally helpful. We do
targeting processing depending on what a patient is dealing with. But we found over
time that with stress and trauma, because so much is information – what you&#39;re seeing,
what you&#39;re hearing, what you&#39;re feeling – that is so easy to process out of you.

Rebekah Kelley: Does it make a difference, whether it&#39;s you or me doing it?
Lisa Klein: So I have, hopefully at this point, very intelligent hands, since I&#39;ve been
doing this for 30 years. It&#39;s a little different when I do it, because I&#39;m also going to be
doing some fascial work. But anybody who has hands can do it.
It&#39;s just the touch; it&#39;s the contact. There&#39;s no pressure. It&#39;s human contact. And how
many people are missing that right now in their houses, home alone? The power of
touch is so important. It is so, so, so important. I think half of my patients come in just so
that we touch them. I mean, you need it for your life; you need it to live. You need
human touch to be an alive person. Again, if you&#39;re home alone, if you&#39;re on your own,
doing the processing is a great way to give yourself the benefits of touch.
Rebekah Kelley: It sounds like I should make this a regular part of my life. Just doing
those touches that you shared with us felt good.
Klein: Right. I do it every night before I go to sleep. I&#39;m processing. I tell my patients,
it&#39;s your official excuse. You can watch TV without feeling guilty because you&#39;re
processing; you&#39;re doing your homework. It&#39;s one of the simplest things and so
effective. And the more you do it, the more it works because your body starts to be like,
“Oh, she&#39;s back.” So you&#39;re giving attention to yourself. You&#39;re giving awareness to
what&#39;s going on. Our bodies are neurologically programmed to respond to touch. And
American medicine has moved so far away from touch. And again, we touch all day
and that&#39;s what we do. There are so many ways that manual medicine is helpful, that
we&#39;re trying to swing things back towards touch, because we&#39;ve grown so far away from
it, unfortunately.
Rebekah Kelley: Especially now with social distancing and not being able to shake
someone&#39;s hand, even minimal interactions are cut down. So I would think that
touching ourselves in these ways that you&#39;re sharing would be so beneficial. If I set a
goal for myself, how much time should I dedicate to this?
Lisa Klein: It depends on how you&#39;re feeling. They like about 20 minutes at a time. If
you want to process adrenal, or some other area, choose one area – adrenal, stomach,
forehead, back of the neck – and just see. What I tell my patients is try them all out 20
minutes each. Whichever one you feel the most from, do more of that one. So if you
feel the most when you go across your forehead, then do that one a lot. You may feel
heat. You may feel buzzing. You may get very relaxed. You may fall asleep. You can
feel heart rate changes. You may start getting hungry. So you go with the one that
produces more of a physiological response.
Rebekah Kelley: You&#39;ve given us these great tools. When do I actually need a
professional to help me with my stress-related issues?
Lisa Klein: If you&#39;re really feeling like you&#39;re having a hard time. We have a lot of

people kicking into depression right now. Anxiety. If you feel like the processing isn&#39;t
helping. If you&#39;re crying a lot. If you really feel like you&#39;re not yourself, then that&#39;s the
time to seek out some professional care. We are flooded with patients right now
because people are tanking. The existing problems that people had are worse and they
are having new issues because their bodies are under so much stress. So we&#39;re just
scrambling.
And it&#39;s really a difficult time because again, our bodies are so not used to not leaving
the house for a year. Who&#39;s used to that? Not going to the gym, all that kind of stuff.
Rebekah Kelley: Yeah. It&#39;s unprecedented.
Lisa Klein: It is absolutely.
Rebekah Kelley: And it&#39;s been a long time. So it&#39;s been building up, we&#39;re like lobsters
and pots that have been cooking slowly.
Lisa Klein: A great way of saying it.
In summary, what we&#39;d like you to know from this talk is that the hands are powerful
tools for helping our bodies deal with stress and trauma. Very, very powerful. And
organs that are under stress love to be touched. They love, love, love the attention, and
it will help them a lot. The symptoms that you’re having may be because of prolonged
stress and trauma on your body, and manual medicine is a very effective tool for
helping process some of that out, to help you be more comfortable. Especially in a time
of a prolonged pandemic, you want to stay on it. You want to find a tool that works for
you and keep doing it until we&#39;re out of this mess.

Rebekah Kelley: Welcome to the Humanized podcast, all about personalizing your
health. I am your host, Rebekah Kelley. Here to share her knowledge today is Lisa Klein.
We&#39;re so excited to have her. She&#39;s a physical therapist, and during this podcast we&#39;ll be
discussing, How Prior Injuries Contribute to Chronic Pain and Dysfunction. Before I
introduce Lisa, I want to remind everyone to subscribe, to get all of our variety of casts
in audio, video and transcription at HumanizedHealth.com. I&#39;d also like to thank our lead
sponsor, Village Green Apothecary at MyVillageGreen.com.
A little bit about our guest – Lisa Klein is a physical therapist and the founder and owner
of Total Health Physical Therapy, a physical therapy practice specializing in manual
therapy and total body rehabilitation. Lisa spent the entirety of her 30-year career
pursuing excellence in manual medicine and total body-mind healing.
Welcome Lisa. So great to have you.
Lisa Klein: I&#39;m happy to be here.
Rebekah Kelley: So, Lisa, define prior injuries.
Lisa Klein: So, when we were thinking about what to do for this episode, one thing that
we talk about a lot in my practice is why are people in pain and the titration of my literal
30 years of practice. I know I look younger than that, I started when I was 5 [both laugh].
Most people come in because they have an injury or an illness, something that kind of
puts them over the edge. But when we do a deep dive on most of our patients, I&#39;d say
9.9 out of 10, we find that they had things going on before, from older injuries, that
were never reset. We talk about this all day, every day, and about why some people
have injuries that go away, why some people have more resilience than other people,
and how things can happen in your life that you don&#39;t think are a big deal at the time
actually cause a multitude of problemos later on. And there are areas that we look at for
that.
Rebekah Kelley: Well, I know that for myself, I&#39;ll forget about something. I&#39;ll forget I did
something or you just move on to the next thing. So how can I know, or how can
someone know if a prior injury is related to current issues that they&#39;re experiencing, and
how as a practitioner do you pull that out?

Lisa Klein: Well, most of it is that people have an unusual reaction to an injury. So we
were treating a professional umpire. He was beamed in the head by balls twice in a
game, which is kind of unusual. And he was literally out for 6 years. So we have his
testimonials actually on our YouTube channel – it&#39;s awesome. But… getting hit in the
head with a ball is not good, but he could not recover. And so the kicker is, when do you
not recover from an injury? And that means that there&#39;s something else that was
already going on and you lost your resilience. So we&#39;ve treated him, he&#39;s still on the
caseload, he&#39;s done it – he&#39;s back to all of his previous activities. He&#39;s fully functional,
but he comes in because he keeps wanting to get better, better, better. And what came
out from that was, the injury that put him over the edge was the being hit in the head
with a ball, but he had had skiing accidents, he had football injuries and his body at a
certain point, it was like, “We’re out.”. So part of it is to figure out, are you not being
able to recover from a current injury in a way that is not really necessarily expected.
Does that make sense?
Rebekah Kelley: It does.
Lisa Klein: How we find it with our hands is that we&#39;re trained to feel fascial areas of
lock. So in regenerative orthopedics, this is called &quot;fascial drag&quot; or &quot;fascial bind.&quot; So
we&#39;re manually trained physical therapists, and the thing that is the most cuckoo
bananas is that we can put our hands on and feel what&#39;s happening in your body. I
wouldn&#39;t believe it either, it&#39;s crazy, but it&#39;s really fantastic. And fascia is basically every
bit of connective tissue that binds your body together. So your Achilles tendon is a type
of fascia. Your IT [iliotibial] band is a type of fascia. The joints in your shoulders, rotator
cuff, all these things are examples of fascial tissues that whenever you have an injury or
whatever, that fascia is going to load, and the fascia can only load so much. And then
you&#39;re going to have problems.
So how we&#39;re trained is to feel for where is the fascia the stuckest. We call it “stuck
dude” sometimes. So where&#39;s the area of stuckitude – and it may not be the area where
the patient comes in with their complaint. It might be, but we look at the whole body to
try and figure out, okay, where&#39;s the REAL problem? Where is the biggest problem?
Rebekah Kelley: Is there in fascia the head? So you can feel it literally...
Lisa Klein: Well, the thing about the head is, the skull is actually pretty thin. So how we
can feel through is that it&#39;s like princess and the pea. We&#39;re trained to feel
[demonstrating feeling forehead, then skull] – you can feel skin, that&#39;s not hard to do.
Here is the skull. But the dura... so the tissue under the cranium is very thick. So the
thicker and more important... the more important the tissue, the thicker the fascia

around it. So the pericardial tissue is very thick. The lung tissue is very thick. The tissue
around the brain spinal cord is very thick. So we&#39;re going for these really thick areas that
are going to hold that load.
Rebekah Kelley: So what are some key areas in the body that can cause issues later?
Obviously the head, which is the example you gave, right?
Lisa Klein: Yep. So there are two areas. Well, there are many, but the primary joints are
L5-S1, where the lumbar spine hits the top of the sacrum. That is a key joint cause it
works as a hinge and it stabilizes the entire brain and spinal cord. So any trauma to your
sacrum, to your SI joints, to your pelvis, is really important. And then we look in the
head. So in the head there&#39;s only one bone and that goes from one side of the cranium
to the other, that&#39;s the sphenoid [demonstrates location by touching right and left
temples], and it&#39;s the occiput right by the spinal cord [points to location at back base of
skull], and that joint inside the cranium mirrors L5-S1. So when we talk about, when
we&#39;re treating, we call it bowling balls, swim noodles. So it&#39;s like you have a swim
noodle, that&#39;s the spinal cord, and you have a bowling ball on each end, the head and
the sacrum, and you want to see, where&#39;s the driver. So when people come in, we&#39;ve
had patients who have horrific back pain because they had way too many broken areas.
We&#39;ve had people come in with headaches and issues in the neck because of stuff in the
sacrum and the legs. So we look at that whole chain. So anytime if you&#39;ve had a lot of
injuries to your butt, to that sacrum area, that could cause all kinds of head issues. And
again, anything from here up [gestures from neck, upward] that is not so regular.
Rebekah Kelley: Wow. So then I guess when people come in, not only are you feeling
and discovering, do you also take a deep in-depth understanding of whether they&#39;ve had
injuries, you ask questions related to it?
Lisa Klein: I have an intake form. So, there&#39;s a book that I bought when I was first going
to school. It was a book for doctors called, Kill As Few Patients As Possible. And it was a
book about [laughs] how to provide good patient care. I&#39;m a PT, but it was like, it was a
good book. And one thing in there was, if you ask your patient long enough, the right
questions, they&#39;ll tell you what happened and how to fix it. So our intake form is literally
14 pages long. We ask for everything that&#39;s ever happened to you and all your
symptoms. Now that being said, people forget things, especially dudes – no judgment –
dudes forget things all the time, dudes, they don&#39;t tell you anything. So you have to ask
specific questions. What sports did you play in high school? What sports did you play in
college? So, yeah, you have to do a deep dive. So we try and get as much information as
we can and then we put our hands on and usually we can find... It could be that where
the patient&#39;s coming in might be the problem, but often it&#39;s not, it&#39;s kind of an older

injury that they forgot about, that the fascia and all the really important tissue is not
moving.
Rebekah Kelley: Right. That&#39;s really fascinating. Thanks, Lisa. Those are really valuable
insights.

Rebekah Kelley: Welcome to the Humanized podcast, all about personalizing your
health. I am your host, Rebekah Kelley. Here to share her knowledge today is Lisa Klein,
a physical therapist, and the subject of the podcast is, how does manual therapy help to
reset prior injuries to fix current pain and dysfunction. And before I introduce Lisa, I
want to remind everyone to subscribe, to get all of our variety of casts in audio, video
and transcription at HumanizedHealth.com. I&#39;d also like to thank our lead sponsor,
Village Green Apothecary, at MyVillageGreen.com.
Thank you, Lisa, for being here. So grateful to have you. A little bit about Lisa. She is a
physical therapist, the founder and owner of Total Health Physical Therapy, a PT
practice specializing in manual therapy and total body rehabilitation. Lisa has spent the
entirety of her 30-year career pursuing excellence in manual medicine and total body-
mind healing.
Welcome Lisa. Thanks for being here. So, if you know there&#39;s a prior injury contributing
to your physical pain today, what can be done about it? Can it be fixed?
Lisa Klein: So this is what we do all day long – yes. So this is often the key to turning
around somebody who&#39;s been in a chronic pain paradigm – finding out why. And the
work that we do really parallels a lot of the research coming out that is backing up
doctors using the PRP and the prolotherapy to release fascial binds. We do it with our
hands, obviously, and we feel like we can go really deeply and comprehensively that
way.
So, yes. Fascia is an important tissue that will bind and protect any tissue that&#39;s been
injured. And often if it&#39;s a soft tissue, it&#39;s an artery or nerve or something very important
to the body that&#39;s been injured and is locking down. So we take our hands and we go to
those areas and we free them up using a variety of fascial techniques.
So we have about 20,000 fascial techniques that we use – 20,000 because we work on
every different tissue differently. They all hold load differently. And then we work to
reset them to where they were before the injury. So the goal is basically to make
whatever happened to them unhappen. But every tissue has its own biomechanics,
meaning how it moves, so we need techniques for every single tissue. So we work on
nerves, arteries, veins, limbs, organs, whatever. We work on every type of tissue. And
the goal is to free up whatever got stuck and then reset and help the patient go on their
merry way without any more pain.

Rebekah Kelley: So how, I mean, you said you have 20,000, but can you give us a little
bit of an idea of how the techniques work and does it stay fixed, or do people have to
come back and see you again?
Lisa Klein: What we do is with the hands on, so using the hands in different ways to
manipulate the tissue. It&#39;s not at all like massage, people think about, that “I love
massage,” but everything that we do is a little bit more gentle than that. Trying to get to
that all important fascial tissue. And once we find the problem and work to fix it, it
holds, because [we&#39;re] trying to find the why or the driver of the problem, which is
usually an area that has been damaged and needs to be helped a little bit to heal. So if
we&#39;re doing our jobs, then the problem should stay fixed. It&#39;s just a matter of how many
layers are there, to fix the problem. We work with a lot of patients with ... we mostly
work with patients who have failed regular PT. So we work with a lot of patients with
fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, vertigo, tinnitus, concussion, POTS, just all kinds of more
complicated structural issues. And the goal is to treat enough so you hit critical mass so
the body can then heal. But the longer it&#39;s been there, it can take some time.
Rebekah Kelley: Now, obviously something&#39;s being repeated, like if someone is, I don&#39;t
know, carrying a really heavy shoulder bag on one side, right? Then it&#39;s going to, they&#39;re
going to come back to see you.
Lisa Klein: Yeah, that&#39;s not great. But the more, the worse things are people… like I have
had people who were [on] horseback, like they would jump horses, and I&#39;m like,
whatever you do, don&#39;t fall off your horse. And they fall off their horse. You know, if the
trauma is worse, so if they&#39;re involved in a high-level sport, we&#39;ll often have them take a
little bit of a break because they&#39;re just continuing to irritate the tissue, and yes, if
they&#39;re doing something that&#39;s irritating it over and over again, that&#39;s not very helpful.
Rebekah Kelley: Typically, how much time do people spend? Like if they&#39;re coming in for
something. I&#39;m assuming it varies, but is there kind of a general perspective or range?
Lisa Klein: If they&#39;re coming in for headaches or radicular pain, it usually takes us about
five visits to start to knock things down a little bit. So we have them come in once a
week for about a month or month and a half, and they should have a nice move
forward. We also give them things to do at home. And then from there, they either
come in every week or every other week and we start to decrease the frequency.
Rebekah Kelley: I was wondering if you gave them homework, I assumed so.
Lisa Klein: We do. We give them what&#39;s called processing, which is holding different
parts of the body to help the metabolism continue to change. And we&#39;re very big on ice.

We love ice. So yeah, we have patients do ice programs, cause it&#39;s the easiest way to run
a nerve off, is to ice the heck out of it. So we have them ice quite a bit.
Rebekah Kelley: Right. And you know, if someone&#39;s had an injury a while ago, right? I&#39;m
going to use myself as an example. I broke my wrist back in December of 2019, went
through physical therapy. I lift weights. I use it all the time, but there&#39;s still certain things
I can&#39;t do or that are very sensitive to [do]. Obviously, the bone is very strong. Is that
something you can help with?
Lisa Klein: Sure. Often there are remnant bone bruises that need to be manually fixed
and things like that, where you have to manually reset the tissue. Often – I&#39;m sorry, was
it broken or it was just sprained?
Rebekah Kelley: Oh no, all three bones. It was pointing in that direction.
Lisa Klein: Right. If you have enough force to break the bone, think about what
happened to the ligament, the tendon, the artery, then there is all this stuff that&#39;s
actually way more important than the bone, to be honest with you. The bone is like,
who cares? It&#39;s just the bone. But the bigger issue is, how&#39;s the artery doing? How&#39;s the
nerve doing? And all of those soft tissues will swell and then scar. And that&#39;s where the
fascia comes in. It locks it down and then it just stays locked. So, yes, what we would do
in that case, you&#39;re already doing the functional work. So we would work on the
structure to get the structure back to where it was before the accident.
Rebekah Kelley: And I know also it took like 7 hours before I was seen, because I wasn&#39;t
as important, you know, it&#39;s just a broken bone. So 7 hours of the tissue being probably
damaged, or whatever. I&#39;m sure it takes a little while for it to recover.
Thank you, Lisa, those are really important… and especially for me, I certainly learned
something that could be very helpful. Lisa Klein can be found at

A little bit about Lisa. She is the founder and owner of Total Health Physical Therapy, a physical therapy practice specializing in manual therapy and total body rehabilitation. Lisa has spent the entirety of her 30-year career pursuing excellence in manual medicine and total body-mind healing.
Lisa, thanks so much for being with us again. It's always a pleasure.
Lisa Klein: My pleasure. 
Rebekah Kelley: So I'm going to just jump right in there. What is manual therapy? Please educate us. Let us know what you spent this past 30 years doing. 
Lisa Klein: [Laughs] Seriously. So most people, when they think of physical therapy, when they hear those words, they think of exercises, ultrasound modalities, heat-cold packs, e-stim [electrical stimulation], which is all great stuff. But my interest was always more in doing hands-on care. I'm not sure why. I mean, people kind of gravitate towards different modes of treatment. So from the beginning of my career, I was always really interested in hands-on. So I had taken some massage training, I'd mess around with classmates during labs and I'm like, oh, you know, the hands-on stuff really is kind of effective. So it really piqued my interest. So throughout the course of my career, I started to take manual therapy classes in terms of trying to figure out, okay, what does this do, and is it something I could specialize in? My first several classes were with the Upledger Institute in Florida. John Upledger was a really brilliant osteopath, and he popularized craniosacral therapy. He also did a lot of myofascial release and he was kind of like the Grand Buba of manual therapy for a long time, in terms of taking it into more of a craniosacral direction. We can talk about it, as well. But I started going to the classes and it was so different from what I learned in PT school. But I was really intrigued by what the hands could do. And I think one of the things that, it's on my homepage of my website, it's like the whole concept of putting your hands on someone and helping them to feel better is kind of basic. You know, it's been around for thousands of years, like before we had any type of medical care, we always had our hands. And I feel like in a lot of ways, to go back to some of those ways of healing that actually are really effective is kind of a good idea. 
Rebekah Kelley: It's a very good idea. Yes, yes. 
Lisa Klein: Thank you. So what we noticed was that a lot of patients who come in have issues and not everything shows up on an x-ray. I had a patient bring in her MRI today and the MRI and the labs and the patient presentation may or may not line up. And one thing that I was learning during all of my training was that sometimes the manual diagnostics and assessments are actually more accurate in terms of figuring out what's happening in the body. So I can't tell you how many times patients come in and the MRI is clean, the labs can be clean, and we find all kinds of stuff to treat. Because the hands are actually very sensitive and they can be trained. So throughout my training, I started with Upledger craniosacral myofascial release, I did a ton of St. John neuromuscular training, which is like a very pointed massage kind of technique. And then I started studying with the lady who became my mentor, and what I'm continually surprised about every day is how much the hands can do, and how they can be trained to not only find problems, but also fix problems. And so yeah, it's kind of an interesting situation there. 
Rebekah Kelley: So, I want to go back to this hands healing concept. Because I think I had that experience, but differently, not in physical therapy, but I had actually broken a wrist and it was being reduced, and I wasn't on any painkillers, they just did a local, which was still painful. And the nurse just came in and held my hand and I went from almost like screaming pain to sudden peace, despite... Just the touch of her hand was amazing. 
Lisa Klein: Yeah. I have patients, I think, who keep seeing see me just because we provide hands-on care, because everybody's so touch starved. So, in this country, we've moved away from a lot of those more primal and kind of intuitive ways of treating patients. We're very pharmaceutical based, which there's a time and a place for, a very surgical place. There's a trauma, a time and a place for, but those are not the only games in town. And traditional medicine, hundreds of, maybe 120 or 30 years ago, there were a lot of other modalities around osteopathic medicine, chiropractic, naturopathic medicine. There were other modalities that were being used. And so what we do in terms of the hands-on care is most similar to traditional osteopathic medicine, especially European osteopathy, where we put our hands on, we feel what's going on. And one of the things that is really interesting is that when you train your hands, like everybody's familiar with how comforting it is to touch someone, hold somebody's hand and just be touched. Right? The up-step from that is massage, which is fabulous and feels amazing. 
Rebekah Kelley: Amazing. 
Lisa Klein: I'm totally for massage. Yeah, totally for massage. When the goal is to turn around a child with cerebral palsy or autism or someone who has two failed spinal fusions, massage is good, but it may not really get into the tissue in the way that you really need to, to turn around a neurological paradigm. And that was always my interest. So massage is one of my first trainings, in craniosacral, which is great. The thing that's really interesting is that our bodies are not solid. Our bodies are made of thousands of layers of tissue, all of which is moving, all of which is connected, and all of which is communicating and trying to keep you alive and healthy and well.
And what we found over the years is that when you put your hands on and the hands are trained to feel these different layers, you can pick up in the patient's body, what's the problem. You can feel all kinds of physical issues. You can feel emotional issues. You can feel all kinds of things that are set in the body. We're going to talk in the next segment about more specifics of myofascial release. But the hands can be trained to pick up all manner of things. And it's really interesting. The body, in some ways, it's like a big cocktail party where every cell is doing its own little thing and everybody should be happy, and they're in their little space and doing their own little metabolism, and it shouldn't be like, I can't do my work because of the liver or the adrenals or because somebody poked me in the eye or something. So what we are trained to feel manually is, okay, who is not okay, who is unhappy? And also, why are they unhappy?
So we have many patients who come in with all kinds of spinal issues, all kinds of hip pain, back pain, knee pain, headaches and stuff. But what we're looking for is where's the root of the problem. And often the root of a chronic, annoying, painful, function-limiting issue may not be something that's going to show up on an MRI or a CT scan. There's a whole world of tissue disruption that is not bad enough to show up on imaging. So imaging is great, do it to rule out things that are very severe, but just because you have a clean MRI or CT scan doesn't mean you have nothing going on. And we see that every day. 
Rebekah Kelley: So, the way you describe it, it's this beautiful symphony, right? That there's some things that are maybe out of alignment or maybe the oboes, not in playing the right key or something. You've got to kind of really understand what's happening with that music and you have to put your hands on it to kind of discover it. Can you give us an example of something that you... Are there any successes, if that's the right word, that pop to mind that you could share with us? 
Lisa Klein: 8 million. So, yeah. [Laughs]. One is, we had a patient who came in originally, who had had years of foot pain, just all kinds of issues in her feet. Both feet. She'd had some surgery, but still the pain. And in my experience, often chronic foot pain is actually coming from the spine because the nerves that come out of the spine that go down to the feet are very long, which sounds like kind of a silly thing to say, but there are many opportunities for those nerves to get clipped. And we call that a crush. So you can have single crushes, double crushes, that the actual symptom that you feel is not going to be at the area of the problem. So again, how we're trained through – I mean, I've had thousands of hours of training and practice – is to put our hands on and say, okay, what's the problem. So we put our hands on the feet. Are you good? What's happening here? Is there inflammation? Is there scar tissue? Like, what is in the feet? And then we work our way up, like what's going on in the knees and in the hips and in the pelvis and the spine, and then the head. So with this patient, the problems actually were further up the chain, more like in her head and neck. And we've been treating that and it took six visits and her foot pain is like, gone. 
Rebekah Kelley: That's amazing. What a wonderful thing for her to have you help solve, right? Because, I mean, your feet are so important to you, where you're walking, you're moving, you're living your life and if it's hard to move your feet around... wow. 
Lisa Klein: Yup, yup. 
Rebekah Kelley: I love this story. Is there anything else that you'd like to share with us today that perhaps I didn't ask about that you think might help someone who's potentially considering physical therapy and particularly your hands-on modality? 
Lisa Klein: I think the thing would be, don't get discouraged. You know your body, if you're in pain, if you're having a hard time, so what if the MRI is clean, or if the labs are clean. That means nothing. That doesn't mean you don't have a problem. So I think for a lot of people, they put too much emphasis on the imaging and on the labs and like, look, I know my body, I know I'm not well. So if that's how you feel, get to a practitioner who has some different ways of assessing what's happening. Acupuncture can do great diagnostics, maybe it's physiology. So it's kind of like, don't stop, keep looking for someone who could really look at you and really look to see what is happening there in a more subtle way. You don't have a tumor, you don't have terrible things happening, but that doesn't mean you don't have problems. And again, we do the manual diagnostics because we find them to be pretty accurate, which is awesome.

So about Lisa. Lisa is a physical therapist and the founder and owner of Total Health Physical Therapy, a PT practice specializing in manual therapy and total body rehabilitation. Lisa has spent the entirety of her 30-year career pursuing excellence in manual medicine and total body-mind healing.
So, Lisa, thank you so much for being with us. It's always a pleasure. So let's get right into it. Talk to us about myofacial release. 
Lisa Klein: Okay. So, when the team that I ended up studying with and being mentored by was trying to figure out how can you help people better, how can you be more efficient and effective, this was mostly a team of physical therapists, although one was a PT and a chiropractor, and the goal of the team was how to help neuropediatrics, actually, more. And the goal was to figure out, how can you find out what's wrong inside the body? And what they did is look at, what is happening in the body – cellular physiology, pathophysiology, anatomy, path, and make anatomy – and there's a lot of research coming out as to the power of fascia and how, again, every cell is covered with a lipid bi-layer, everything is covered with a layer of a fascial envelope. So again, from every cell to the liver, where the fascia around the liver is enormous. 
So you have this system that's now being considered like another organ platform because it's so important. It takes into consideration different types of tissues. So your IT band is a kind of fascia. Your Achilles tendon is a kind of fascia. Your pericardium is fascia. It's a type of tissue that is mostly collagen. And it's not muscle, it's not bone, it's not nerve, it's not lymph, it's not artery, but it's this in-between tissue that basically surrounds everything and controls everything, in a way. It metabolizes, it's filled with water. It's kind of like the glue that everything is sitting in in your body. So it's a regulator, it's a protector. 
And what we found in manual therapy is that when we can put our hands on a patient and tune into, with our hands, the fascia, the fascia will tell us what's happening in that body. Because anything that happens to your body physically, even emotionally, [for example] trauma physiology, will imprint on that fascia. And so what the team developed was a way of assessing patients called fascial mapping. So what we do when patients come in to see us is we map their fascia. We're trying to figure out what happened to you. And what has created inflammation and scarring in the fascia that then is affecting the rest of how your body's functioning.
Rebekah Kelley: That's amazing. That's amazing. 
Lisa Klein: Oh, it's super cool. It's super cool. 
Rebekah Kelley: Super cool. Okay. 
Lisa Klein: Yeah.[Laughs]
Rebekah Kelley: Tell us more, tell us more. 
Lisa Klein: Okay. Okay. So the more important the organ tissue, the thicker of the fascia around it. So people know your pericardium, that's a very thick membrane around your heart. The dura – everybody's heard of an epidural, right? – the dura, which is short for dura mater, which is ""tough mother,"" is this extremely thick membrane that surrounds your whole brain and spinal cord. Every nerve in your body, to get where it's going, has to go through that fascia, through that dura. When the dura is bound, anywhere in the system, it will take up the slack and make it harder for the nerves to go through it. So this is how patients go into chronic pain, complex regional pain syndrome, migraine headaches. Many, many aspects of pain are related to how well are the nerves able to pierce that dura and how mobile is the dura in the body. 
Rebekah Kelley: Wow. 
Lisa Klein: So it's tremendous. That's just an example. Your connective tissue – the dura, pericardium, pleural tissue, the ligaments around the liver, your respiratory diaphragm – your body has these very important, we call them the ""usual suspects."" So when somebody comes in with chronic pain, we're like, okay, what are the usual suspects doing? What's the dura during? The thing that's great, again, about manual therapy in the hands is that they can be trained to feel for these tissues. You can get information about what's going on in the dura from an MRI or CT scan, but it's not going to show you the dynamics. It's not going to show you scar tissue unless it's to a certain level of scar tissue.
So again, you have a whole world of mechanics and tissue that's supposed to be moving and you will have problems, you'll have pain and dysfunction when that movement stops. So we often see children who are having problems as they hit the teenage years. It's because often they've had trauma from either 12 or below that wasn't really reset, because you know, who really does that, but now that they're growing, now you see the problem. So all of our kids who come in with POTS, headaches, all kinds of teenagers, when you dial back, you're like, oh, they had this pretty significant injury when they were younger that has again bound things down in an area, and now they're growing on scar tissue. But that can also happen with adults. 
Rebekah Kelley: Right. 
Lisa Klein: Yeah, so basically our bodies are filled with these really important tissues that all need to be moving on each other. And when that doesn't happen, that's when you have problems. And people all the time say, well, I was in a car accident. I had a patient who was in a rollover car. Oh, I was fine. I'm like, you are not fine. You walked away, but you were not ""fine."" You know, your tissue is imprinted from all that trauma. Like, the body doesn't just poof it back up again. You have to set that tissue over. 
Rebekah Kelley: So, just because I'm really not aware and I'm not sure our listeners and watchers are aware, how exactly do you accomplish myofascial release? When you say you put hands on...
Lisa Klein: That's a good question. So, people say, is it like massage? And I'm like, not so much. So, muscles are fabulous and I love massage. And when you want to open up a muscle, you have to fill it with blood and bring the spasm down. So manually kneading a muscle works great for that. The fascia though is a little bit thinner. It's like thick layers or thinner layers of saran wrap. So when we're working on the fascia, we're very light and it's a very interesting thing. We're kind of on the body, we're moving the fascia very, very gently in this methodology. If you want to do deep, you have to go light, because if you start putting a lot of pressure on, the body will push you out. So myofascial release is a very light and very gentle technique, where you're working to reset the tissues that got smashed by something that happened. 
Rebekah Kelley: So that's why it's hard for you to get in, right? Because it's pushing out, it's protecting. 
Lisa Klein: It's already smushed. You got it. 
Rebekah Kelley: You're having to gently go in and almost ease it in so that it's like... yes. Wow. 
Lisa Klein: Yes. So say, for example, if you're in a car accident, you hit your head on the windshield, right? All that tissue in terms of physics that was affected is going to lock down, because that's the only thing the body can do, swell, and then scar. So what we do is we would come in with our hands, we do the opposite of those forces. We take the tissue where it wants to go. We open it up, it's called creating a fascial fulcrum, and we basically make those forces unhappen and say, okay, now can you reset to where you were before?
So, the entirety of myofascial release is about decompressing tissue that was either physically traumatized and got stuck that way, or physiologically or whatever got swollen inflammation, which breeds scar tissue. So we're like little fascial fairies where we just go [laughs], say okay, what happened? What happened? What happened? And we're going in, and we're basically helping the body to reset from what happened. 
Rebekah Kelley: Our bodies are so smart, how they decide to protect.
Lisa Klein: They are, they are! And they know what's happening. The body never makes a mistake. It's more like, okay, why are you doing this? Why is this a presentation that we're seeing? And always, we can figure out, I'd say 99% of the time, what happened. Okay, well, your body's doing this because when you were 8 years old, you fell off a rope swing onto your head. Which I've had a patient that happened to, and then she had other concussions and then she had another concussion, and then she was out. Her body's like, I'm out. The white flag went up. But when we dialed it back, say, okay, how are you in so much dysfunction at 20 something? It's like, oh, you know, falling off a rope swing onto your head at 8 years old will cause a tremendous amount of unhappiness in the head, and it stays there. It doesn't just open up again. That's not how things happen. It's against every law of physics. So, yes. 
Rebekah Kelley: So if we're being told, oh, you know, you're all right. We don't see anything. You're fine. But yet you're still not feeling all that well, the body's basically saying, get some help. Right? 
Lisa Klein: Right. Exactly. So it's more subtle things. You may not have, again, a broken neck, but you can have soft tissue fractures of the neck. So, imaging is good, but it's not the be all and end all. It's like, let's get our hands on, see what happened. If you had physical trauma to your body, it left a mark. And at a certain point, you may have too much of that happen, and your body's like, bye-bye. 
So you're trying to figure out what happened to the person and then reverse those forces. Reset the fascia and open up everything to be able to move correctly. 
Rebekah Kelley: Well, and this podcast really is all about personalizing your health and nutrition, right? So, this particular physical therapy, myofascial release, is going to be very personal to everybody that you've had, whether it's from childhood, whether it's as an adult. And I know for me, I sometimes forget things that happened. Like, you know, you roll with it and you keep on going, so [you think] it might not be connected. So how do you... I'm assuming you do an intake where you ask people questions, or you have a... 
Lisa Klein: We have a 14-page intake form. So the patient gives us an entire history. But often they don't remember some important stuff, which is totally fine. So we have a symptom checkoff sheet. So we have a lot of information before we put hands on them. And then we put hands on them. We look at how they're standing. We look at the range of motion, we get them on the table and then we're like, okay, fascia, tell me what you need to tell me.
So when I was first training in this, I was like, all right, let me see if I can figure this out because it takes a lot of practice. So for years, I'd have the patient not tell me anything. I wouldn't look at the intake and I would map them first. And then I'd be like, okay, what are we looking at? And then I look at the intake and the history, and by doing that hundreds of times, and you're like, okay, you know, my hands are getting a lot of practice here. I can often pick up the main issue when the patient is in, before I even look at the history, but then the history gives you some valuable information.
So the goal is to train up your hands so you can get what you need out of the body. We listen to what the patient says, but we don't treat by that. We treat by what the body tells us. Because half the time, again, the patient's forgotten some critical stuff. 
Rebekah Kelley: Wow, thanks, Lisa. Those are really, that's amazing. So, listeners out there, you know now, like if something's going on, it's not showing up, see what you can do with myofascial release.

I am your host, Rebekah Kelly, and we have a great guest today, Dr. Ritamarie Loscalzo, and we're going to be talking about the real global pandemic - blood glucose dysregulation, and how to detect it before it destroys your health. But before I introduce Dr. Loscalzo, I want to remind everyone to subscribe, to get all the variety of casts - in audio, video, and transcription, at humanizedhealth.com. I'd also like to thank our lead sponsor, Village Green Apothecary, and MyVillageGreen. 
So, Dr. Loscalzo, thank you so much for being here. I'm just going to read your bio real quick. Our guest, Dr. Ritamarie Loscalzo, is a licensed Doctor of Chiropractic with certifications in acupuncture, nutrition, herbal medicine, and heart math. Her specialties include digestion, thyroid, adrenal, and insulin imbalances. Dr. Ritamarie is the founder of the Institute of Nutritional Endocrinology, best-selling author, speaker, and internationally recognized nutrition and women's health authority with over 28 years of clinical experience.
What a great bio. Thanks for being here. 
Dr. Ritamarie Loscalzo: Thank you so much for inviting me. I'm excited. This is one of my favorite topics to talk about. 
Rebekah Kelley: Awesome. Well, so I have to ask you, what is blood glucose dysregulation? Cause I don't think, I even know. 
Dr. Ritamarie Loscalzo: Well, it's basically...  glucose is in our blood and we know that people get diabetes when they have too much glucose in their blood. But what they don't realize is that the body needs to regulate that exact right amount to keep our brain energized, to keep our organs running and to keep us from getting overweight, actually. So, it's basically the regulation, the hormonal regulation of the hormone insulin, that keeps the glucose in the perfect range, the Goldilocks range.
Rebekah Kelley: So, why do you call it a pandemic? Like, I mean, obviously we're in the midst of a pandemic, but... 
Dr. Ritamarie Loscalzo: So many people have blood glucose dysregulation, and that don't know it. I mean, it's worldwide. It's one of the leading causes of death. It's one of the leading causes of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other things that are the leading causes of death. But people don't look at it. It's actually one of the leading causes of death in this pandemic. Right? Because when people's blood sugar is out of balance, viruses grow. The immune system is a wreck. So, I call it a pandemic because it is global, right? It's worldwide, and it's in such great numbers that it's killer. Like one in four people have already been detected to have, or one in three, it might be, to detected to have some degree, using standard medical measures. But it's estimated that actually one in two, and some authors estimate that 88% of people have some degree of glucose dysregulation. And it's a precursor to diabetes. Even if it doesn't proceed all the way to diabetes, it's dangerous in and of itself.
And speaking of dangers, what are they?
Yeah, so high levels of insulin cause the blood vessel linings to get stiff. So, think about your blood vessel linings. Sometimes you're just calm and there's a certain amount of blood coursing through. Then you have to run to catch the bus, right? And you need this big flow of blood. You need flexibility in your arterial system. What insulin, high levels of insulin do, is it causes them to stiffen. So, you can get into a lot of trouble if you try to run for the bus, if you're in that state. It also causes high levels of, well it causes the blood pressure to go up, as well.
Okay. It causes damage to various organs. It causes problems with the digestive track. It causes inflammation, and that's all insulin. Insulin is the hormone that helps us to keep the blood sugar regulated. When we're eating sweet food, starchy food, foods that have hydrogenated and other kinds of alternate unhealthy fats, we have a problem where we can't keep our sugars regulated. When the sugars go up higher than they need to be, a lot of insulin is produced by the pancreas to get it back down. After a while the cells, because they're protecting themselves from the dangers of insulin, they get resistant and we create a situation called insulin resistance.
When we're resistant, then the blood sugar keeps going up. So, what happens when the sugar keeps going up and insulin can't get it down - we get damage to the retinas in the eyes. We get damage to the little nerves, the peripheral nerves that supply the fingers and the toes. We get damage to the kidneys, we get damage to the cardiovascular system. So, all of these things can lead to all sorts of dangerous things. And everybody's like, oh, it's just a little sugar, it's just a little sugar. It doesn't really matter. I don't have diabetes. In reality, people can have this dysregulation decades before the diagnosis of diabetes, because I think that the methods that we use in Western medicine are primitive and archaic, and really don't detect things until it's too late. 
Rebekah Kelley: Right. So, how do we know? How can we have this diagnosed or recognized, or take steps so that we don't have decades of this? Like, what does that detection look like? And how does someone who's just wondering, because they have something of what you've suggested, just as a list. How do we find this out? 
Dr. Ritamarie Loscalzo: Yeah. So, there are some symptoms that you may be noticing, right? You may be noticing that you're not really gaining weight, but your belly's getting bigger. You ever notice people get skinny legs and big bellies? That's a sign of glucose insulin dysregulation.
Rebekah Kelley: Really! 
Dr. Ritamarie Loscalzo: Absolutely. Right? 
Rebekah Kelley: Yes, I see that all the time. 
Dr. Ritamarie Loscalzo: You see it all the time. Right? And they're they want to say a little bit of it myself. 
Rebekah Kelley: Yes. 
Dr. Ritamarie Loscalzo: Yeah. Well, yeah, it happens, right? And it doesn't just happen to older people. As you know, as we get older - and I'm not saying you're an older person, but like you're not a teenager anymore, right? But when I used to go to the swim meets - my son was on the swim team - and I would look at these kids, these teenagers who had these beautiful arms from swimming, and they had bellies hanging over their bathing suits, at age 16! Right? So, it's starting really young, because of the junk food that people are eating, because of the stress that people are under. Cortisol, the stress hormone, causes the release of sugars from storage, and then it causes that to be stored back again, because we don't have to run away from any tigers. We're just getting stressed at the psychological things in life. And so we don't burn up that sugar. So, that's what happens years before. 
So, those are some of the symptoms. Brain fog, you know people who get brain fog, like, where are my keys? And what was your name anyway? What was that question you just asked me? Can you repeat that? Brain fog. You're not really all there. And exhaustion fatigue, and a lot of people experience that. And there's a lot of reasons for that, but this is one of the most common causes that people aren't recognizing. So, it's really important. 
There are also lab tests that you can do that most doctors only run after you become diabetic. And I'm like, duh, do we want to know after we become diabetic? Or do we want to know before we become, right? Yeah. I want to know if I'm heading in that direction so I could change my course, and most people do. So, there's something called hemoglobin A1C. Usually doctors don't do it until somebody is diabetic and the numbers are really high, like seven, eight, nine. It should be around five, right? And if we start to test that as part of the annual physical, and maybe you don't do it every year, but you at least get a baseline when somebody is like 19 or 20 or 25, then we see, whoa, that's a little higher than it should be. Let's test it again next year. If it's heading in that direction, we know we're heading towards somebody who's at risk for diabetes. So, that's one. 
Another one is just testing the insulin in the blood. A lot of times, doctors don't even do that with diabetics sometimes, unless they're type 1, and then you have to do it. But insulin in the blood will give us an idea. Are we heading there? Fasting insulin should be low. It should be between, like, two and five on the standards that they measure, because we don't need insulin when we're not eating. Insulin is required when we've got food in the system and we're trying to get it in the bloodstream. Or out of the bloodstream and into the cells.
So, we can test that. And sometimes people, like, I'll test them and have somebody come in and their fasting insulin was in the twenties. People whose fasting insulin is much higher than that even, should be between two and five. Then we know that you're heading in this direction. You may not be there yet. The body's resilient. Bodies are resilient - until it breaks down. 
So, those are some of the ways that we... Oh, the other way is to get a glucose meter. 
Rebekah Kelley: Okay. 
Dr. Ritamarie Loscalzo: This is my favorite way. So, folks who have diabetes know about pricking their finger and testing their blood sugar. Average, normal, regular people can get a glucose meter at the pharmacy for $15, test their sugars, test some before you eat, test them in the morning, test them at night test, test them after eating, and just see, is the blood sugar going up way high after you eat a meal? Sometimes, it's like, if you eat doughnuts and, yeah, it's going to go way high. But that's bad for you. Cause every time it goes high, it's damaging those vessels more. It's damaging the system more, and you're leading to these problems that are really the long-term complications of diabetes but can be prevented early on. 
Rebekah Kelley: Those were very actionable. I mean, I can do those things right now, tomorrow, scheduled. So how do we prevent and reverse this, then? Besides obviously, diagnosing. 
Dr. Ritamarie Loscalzo: Right. Knowing about it - but actually, eating as if taking care of yourself, as if you already have this problem. And it's just general good lifestyle habits, right? Stay away from sugar. For some people staying away from any kind of starches, but not everybody. You know, some people, whole grains are fine and sweet potatoes are fine.
Other people who have specific genetic markers towards this may have to restrict or reduce the amount of any kinds of starchy foods. You see a big predominance, a lot of people are turning towards keto diets right now. Right? I'm not a big fan of the keto diet, with lots of butter and lard and all that kind of stuff, but we can do a keto type diet - low sugars, low starches, higher, good whole foods that are not oils and stuff like that, that's damaging. 
So, the way that we prevent and reverse this is these good habits. And there's five areas that I think need to be addressed. One is the diet, obviously, right? And nutrients, specific nutrients that have been depleted over time, like chromium and magnesium and good fats.
The second one is exercise movement. And everybody says, oh god, you're going to make me exercise. Right? But you know what? The studies have shown that even the easy exercise, like 30 seconds of bursting, going as hard as you can for 30 seconds and then go do it later on, can be super helpful in keeping these levels under control.
Another one is stress. So, you know, okay, again - stress, yeah, yeah, yeah - but there are specific techniques that you can use. I like heart math, which is an amazing technique. There are little tapping types of things. Things that you can when you detect that you're heading into that sympathetic state. That's a part of the nervous system that's, you know, up here and we can pull it back down. And learning to do those things throughout the day - it doesn't mean you have to be a Buddha. It doesn't mean you have to meditate twice a day for 30 minutes or an hour. There are little things you can do throughout the day to reduce the stress. 
And then there's sleep. Sleep is a biggie. A lot of people don't sleep well. Some don't sleep well because there's some metabolic imbalance that needs to be addressed. Some don't sleep well because they don't make it to the bedroom in time, or they get into bed and they're sitting with the cell phone, you know, on social media or looking at emails and they're preventing themselves from getting melatonin levels up because of the light is going into their eyes. So, sleep is super important.
And the last of all is how you time, all of those things. Like the spacing of your meals, how far apart are they? In the olden days, nutritionists were teaching people, oh, you have to eat every 2 hours to keep your blood sugar steady. That's the worst advice possible. You need to be eating two to three discreet meals that cover your bases, with space in between, so the insulin levels go back down to normal and then they respond when you eat again. You need to stay away from eating right at bedtime. Three hours is ideal. Five hours is even better. And now people are now talking about intermittent fasting. When I first started talking intermittent fasting, I don't know, 20 years ago, it was like, this is how you space your meals. Now, everybody's like, oh, do you intermittent fast? How long is your fasting window? But it's super good! It's so popular. Right? I should have coined it. I should've done something with it back then when I started using it. I would be in a different place. 
So, that's basically it.

Rebekah Kelley: Welcome to the Humanized podcast, all about personalizing your health. I'm your host, Rebekah Kelley. Today we'll be discussing The Best Proven Ways to Support and Boost Your Immune System Right Now, with Dr. Mignonne Mary. Before I introduce Dr. Mary, I want to remind everyone to subscribe and get all our variety of casts in audio, video and transcription at HumanizedHealth.com. I'd also like to thank our lead sponsor, Village Green Apothecary, at MyVillageGreen.com. 
A little bit about Dr. Mary. She is the founder and medical director of The Remedy Room, which is a continuation of the legacy of her father, Dr. Charles Mary, Jr., a pioneer in the field of IV vitamin therapy. Dr. Mignonne Mary's passion for the benefits of infusion therapy began with her father and have since developed through years of her own practice and continued education. Today, Dr. Mary's clinics focus on treating the whole person and not just symptoms, health promotion, and disease prevention. The Mary family's approach to wellness and recovery has changed thousands of people's lives and continues to grow each year. Dr. Mary currently practices internal medicine out of The Remedy Room, with an emphasis on nutrition and integrative medicine to use the best that every field of thought has to offer.
Thank you for being with us, Dr. Mary. 
Mignonne Mary: Thank you so much for having me. 
Rebekah Kelley: So we know our bodies want to heal. We have an immune system that, when supported, shows up for us and really helps us weather things thrown at us. Of course, we know that lifestyle matters, and of course, right now, a lot of us are definitely taking some hits to our immune system with the stress that we're currently in. So what can we do to create the environment for our immune system to really be able to kick in and do its job for us right now?
Mignonne Mary: I think, first thing we have to do is to remember to breathe, to stop and pause, take those good deep breaths in, even consider ""box breath"" or some of these other breaths that are regenerative and helping us to calm down the nervous system, like 5-7-8 breathing. 
Getting a good night's sleep. When we start seeing our patients for deeper visits, it's the first thing we address, because if you're not sleeping, you're not recharging. So, we give patients tips on how to focus on the breath going in and out of the nose, as well as the chest rising up and down. And in doing that, focusing on two things at the same time, it cancels out those thoughts that are spinning and spinning. 
Eating organic foods. Eating a rainbow of foods, vegetables, and real food. So currently we have a lot of patients we teach about fasting, which is purposeful, but very helpful in boosting stem cell production. And of course, recently, there's a new study out showing that since everything has happened, people have regressed to eating poor foods and poor food choices, and eating out instead of cooking, and so we're starting to see the impact on the immune system there. So this is a really big, valuable thing that we can do is go back to cooking at home and really choosing the best foods that have the least toxins. 
So, what else? Taking a walk outside, getting reconnected with nature, grounding ourselves. Because with all of the stress that's going on, we're getting depleted of our minerals, our charge isn't correct, there's certainly other toxins that we're being bombarded with from outdoors that we all know about and see popping up everywhere. So it's very important to do sort of these basic things and stopping, taking a breath, taking just even 5 minutes. We promote people to try meditation, whether that's with an app or with TM, Transcendental Meditation, to center themselves and to have time to reflect, and canceling out the negative thoughts because they're going to keep coming. And so the sooner we can flick those thoughts… I read a book from 1933 about Emmet Fox, and he talks about flicking [away] those negative thoughts as fast as we can so that they don't cause damage to your coat or whatever, like a fire burning from an ember. And the longer you let the negative thoughts sit and fester, the harder the damage is to repair. And so I think it's not a matter of not allowing the thoughts and not allowing those emotions to go through us, but think of them like a wave, they'll come and they'll go until we can have the emotion instead of being the emotion.
So those are things to remember in this chaos that is ensuing. The more we can all center ourselves and fill ourselves with love, positivity, we can emulate that, shine out our light and help others by basically being and existing in a positive state. 
Rebekah Kelley: I love that. I love that. 
Mignonne Mary: It's a lot, but we're forgetting. You know, we keep on getting into the weeds and we're getting stuck with worry and fear. And the most important thing we have to remember is love. And so there's a lot that's trying to separate us. There's a lot of blame. There's a lot of shame going on. We need to remember that these are just as much toxins. Emotional toxicity is just as harmful to the body as chemical toxins and as physical stressors.
It's an important piece that we need to keep reminding ourselves of. So what fills your bucket? What fills your heart with love? And then once you can think of that person or that thing, then give that love back to yourself, looking in the mirror and saying I love you, with your name. You'll get chills. You don't talk to yourself much, but every time you kiss your children, do the same to yourself. Kiss yourself on the inside because we all need a lot more love right now. And I know for sure in our practice, one of our core values is leading with love. And so we are here to support others, but I just reminded my staff – if we go down, we're going to be in big trouble and we can't help anyone. So we have to remember to really take care of ourselves too. It's everywhere. 
Rebekah Kelley: Just when you even said, take a breath in, I did. And immediately I felt so much better. Just immediately. 
Mignonne Mary: Yeah. They say the difference between anxiety and an excitement is one breath.
Rebekah Kelley: So what should we stop? 
Mignonne Mary: Should we stop? I would say the negative thoughts, the poor eating habits. I'm a big fan of something I learned from Dr. Pompa – it's don't eat less, just eat less often. I think a large portion we're reading clearly, that the comorbidities and the things that keep us sick are things that are being ignored right now. And we really can do a lot about our health and that starts with prevention, but it also starts with leading a healthy lifestyle. So, removing the toxic foods from our cabinets, getting away from the oils that are hydrogenated and not made from the earth, and eating less often so that we don't call out insulin quite as many times. So we ask our patients to switch all their drinks to water, remove the snacks, maybe go back to like the 1970s and eat breakfast, lunch and dinner. And if you're not hungry, don't eat. There's no hard and fast rule that says because it's 12 o'clock, you must eat. You're not going to fall apart. All of us have purposely fasted for a surgery or a lab, and we can make it.
Our bodies are meant to go many hours without food. We teach our patients how to not only get into a lower carb lifestyle, but what we call therapeutic carb restriction. By lowering these foods, we can help to lower the inflammation. And any time we can lower insulin, we're doing an incredible job of lowering inflammation. And then by teaching them how to fast, we're increasing stem cell production, we're improving the impact of the immune system and giving them a tool that, the reason I love it is, it's free. It's something we've done for thousands of years. And it can greatly impact our brain health, our heart health, everything. And so a lot of this dis-ease can be changed by what we eat. 
Now that's not to say that we don't need to take supplements. Unfortunately, as we all know, we don't have what we need in the food supply. So where we have success with IV nutrients, which is what we're using, I think as we're skipping the GI tract, which is so inflamed and so impactful for the immune system, that we're almost... if we can kind of shift the focus on what can you do at home, instead of just there's nothing can be done, and that's not true. Let's start to refocus the conversation back to the positive, back to that there's hope. Go for that walk, take those 10,000 steps. Get a hot bath, put some magnesium in it. Hug your children more, hug your husband and wife more, even though you don't want to, because you know that ""use it or lose it,"" but also ""fake it till you make it,"" like, more love. And when you see someone's stressed out, pause. And I realize we're scared to even touch each other at this point, but we need more love right now, not less. 
Rebekah Kelley: Let it kick in, right? 
Mignonne Mary: Yes! They say it takes 20 seconds for the oxytocin to be released during a hug. So I always tell my kids, be the last to let go.
Rebekah Kelley: I love that. Be the last. That's really amazing. 
So also, what would you say is in the arsenal if someone needs to go and get some additional support? What might be in that arsenal, and what do you use, what's your go-to if someone comes to you and they need some additional immune support? What do you provide? 
Mignonne Mary: Well, first and foremost, from a nutritional standpoint, obviously, good foods, and then from the supplement standpoint, my number one, you know, every doctor's got a hammer – my hammer is vitamin C. It's been around for ages. It's the most studied vitamin. And I mean, maybe I wish we would stop calling it vitamin C so that that path that everybody has, that knowledge, that is not correct. At least I challenge people. How much do you know, that you really know from your own experience, or how much is it that someone told you? And so, my experience is shown to me by my dad, who was a pioneer in using high doses of IV vitamin C. There are limits that you can take orally, but the doses need to be much higher, based on the fire or the inflammation level in the body. So what the recommended daily allowance recommends is much lower than what is necessary to fight certain illnesses and certain chronic diseases. So increasing the dosing, increasing the timing and the frequency is very important. So vitamin C, for sure. If you can't tolerate it in pill or powder form, then we recommend liposomal form. The liposomal delivery skips the GI tract that could upset someone's stomach and can get into the lymphatics and into the cells and have a higher intracellular dose. If that doesn't work, and then if you're really ill, then intravenous vitamin C. And with that, we can get exponential doses in the blood and in the cells to help with the immune system. It's an invaluable source of something that's very inexpensive, non-toxic, a huge antioxidant. So what it does is it donates an electron. It gives the charge and bridges the patient until the patient's body can heal itself.
Our bodies have this most amazing ability to heal. We are the ones that get in the way, whether that's with our thoughts, with our toxins, with our inability to take in the nutrients, our inability to absorb the nutrients. Either something's blocking us or we don't have enough. And so whether vitamin C is so powerful just because it has this plethora, what we call pleiotropic effect – so that means it covers so many things. It's an anti-inflammatory, it's a huge anti-viral, has been used since the times of polio to help correct those things. It's an antitoxin, snake bites, rattlesnakes, all kinds of spider bites. It's an anti-histamine. We've certainly seen our fair share of people get off of histamine medicines, like Claritin and Allegra and that, with high enough doses of vitamin C. It's a pain reliever, it's imperative for collagen production. So, pre- and post-op surgeries. These people who want to lay down nice collagen. It's really just a crucial lifesaving thing that helps us with our stress hormones. So where we started the conversation, we need it for our adrenals. And the first place that it gets taken from is the adrenal glands. And so we are unable to make our own vitamin C and I think that the amounts that we tell patients, we tell them to take much higher because of the results, in our experience that we've seen, have been phenomenal. 
So next, the only other things... I like three, so C, absolutely. Vitamin D, or the prohormone D – let's call it what it is, it's a hormone. We know the impact of having levels over 50 to 80 on your blood work, and even 80 to 100 if you have a chronic disease. And we have all seen the studies that show that those people fare better, and that if it... Unfortunately, it's not on the standardized test. It would be a really wonderful day, and I'll just keep envisioning what I want to happen, that vitamin C treatment, as soon as you arrive at the hospital, becomes standard of care. That your levels of C, of D, are drawn on admission. You know, these are easy things that we should be focused on because without these foundational building blocks, the immune system cannot do what it needs to do. And so we're bridging and supporting in a natural way, in a non-toxic way, so that again, the body can do exactly what it knows how to do. 
Rebekah Kelley: Awesome. And the third thing? 
Mignonne Mary: The third is magnesium and trace minerals. So a lot of us are focused on zinc, which is in the trace minerals. And so back to the food being deficient, I do think it's important for us to supplement. There's all kinds of new products out there. There's liquid minerals, there's oral minerals. Sometimes I'm having patients who tell me that they're getting nauseated from taking them, but with food, I would recommend, and being careful not to overdose. Some of these things, we have to be cautious, especially the vitamin D. We have a lot of people going really hog-wild with that. And it is important to pair it with vitamin K. So this is something that you're going to want to talk to a doctor who understands nutrition, and/or a nutritionist, who understands vitamins. But it's pretty powerful if we can do these things to support the patient. 
And this is not just for what's going on now. This is for forever. Anything that comes your way. But it's in combination with the lifestyle changes. So just like everything else in life, there's never one thing that makes anything wrong or right, or better or worse. It's a compilation. Think of it like an orchestra. These would be your main players, and then you have the background. The problem that I see is that we try to pin down nature with just one ingredient and it doesn't work like that. We need all these things in concert to work at our optimal levels.
Rebekah Kelley: We're all unique, which is what really this Humanized Health podcast is about, right? It's about personalizing your health and what experiences we have. Everyone's going to have a different symphony, it's going to sound different and be a little bit different, but those are all the players that we actually need to create it for you.

Rebekah Kelley: Welcome to the Humanized podcast, all about personalizing your health. I'm your host, Rebekah Kelley, and today we'll be discussing Raising the Bar on Standard of Care, with Dr. Mignonne Mary. Before I introduce Dr. Mary, I want to remind everyone to subscribe and get all of our variety of casts in audio, video and transcription at HumanizedHealth.com. I'd also like to thank our lead sponsor, Village Green Apothecary, at MyVillageGreen.com. 
A little bit about Dr. Mignonne Mary. She's the founder and medical director of The Remedy Room, which is a continuation of the legacy of her father, Dr. Charles C. Mary, Jr., a pioneer in the field of IV vitamin therapy. Dr. Mary's passion for the benefits of infusion therapy began with her father and have since developed through years of her own practice and continued education. Today, Dr. Mary's clinic focuses on treating the whole person and not just symptoms, health promotion and disease prevention. The Mary family's innovative approach to wellness and recovery has changed thousands of people's lives and continues to grow each year. Dr. Mary currently practices internal medicine out of The Remedy Room, with an emphasis on nutrition and integrative medicine to use the best that every field of thought has to offer. 
Dr. Mary, thank you so much for being here with us.
Mignonne Mary: Thanks Rebekah, I appreciate it. 
Rebekah Kelley: So that's quite a legacy, right? And I really... you're here to tell us about your story and how you got where you are right now. Please, we want to hear it all. 
Mignonne Mary: Okay. So, I'm from New Orleans. I graduated from LSU Medical School in internal medicine, and I come from a family of physicians. My father, at a very young age was one of the youngest directors of a state hospital, of Charity Hospital. And, very, very smart. A lot of people have told me he was born ahead of his time. And so when he left the hospital and started in private practice, he was aware that in the '70s, there really hadn't been much advancement in the treatment of cancer. And so he started looking into other therapies and was in a meeting and met a doctor named Fred Klenner, who was also a pioneer in the use of IV vitamin C and was using IV vitamin C during the polio epidemic and having great success. So he starts using it, and Dr. Klenner challenges him to start using it for the next time he has a patient with Epstein-Barr or mononucleosis. And at that time, as the universe sends you things, you need, not necessarily you want... he sees three patients and starts to get them well. This is mono that usually take kids out and college kids out for a whole semester, and within 2 or 3 days, these people are saying they want a burger and they want to get back to life. So my dad progresses and starts using it for other viral illnesses, such as hepatitis and then eventually HIV. And then certainly to support the patients during their time with cancer. 
Then, fast forward. So he's using it in the office and it's just my normal life to see patients getting IV therapy in an office setting. And honestly, I did think that everybody just did that. You know, I thought when I got out of med school, that that's how it would be. I didn't realize what an anomaly it is until now.
And so he's using IV vitamin C and mega-doses, high doses in the office setting, preventing people from getting to the hospital, and then in the hospital setting as well, and getting great results. 
When I was in high school, my dad developed colorectal cancer, was not expected to live. He went around the world and found some other doctors, but in the meantime started using high doses of vitamin C for himself. And when they resected the piece of his colon, there was nothing there. There was no tumor. So, he has his own experience. And so that just continued to forge us forward, we knew what we were seeing and we knew the experiences we were having were incredible. You know, stories of people with esophageal cancer, who, when you irradiate an area, it scars it and it causes a lot of damage and swelling. And usually those guys do not have a very good diet because they can't eat. And on the last day of his radiation, this patient's eating burgers and feeling great. 
So, you know, the proof is in the pudding. Our patients find when they're in the therapies with other patients, they have more color. Their quality of life is certainly improved. And so we don't make any claims that we're curing cancer. We couldn't certainly do that, but we can say that we support the body system while it is having a large impact from other things such as radiation, chemo and surgery, and we're supporting the cells during this time of trauma and stress. And in that, we're bridging the body so that it can heal itself because, back to what we know – we're energetic beings, our bodies can heal. It's just that we need to get out of the way. 
And so, fast forward that – my older brother is also an internist and he starts using vitamin C in his office, in the Mary Clinic. And then, so as time progressed, I opened up The Remedy Room. And instead of having an office with one room, because through the years, this IV room is getting bigger and bigger, and so I said, well, I'm just going to flip the model and I'll have the whole thing be an IV room, and the offices on the side will be to evaluate the patients and talk to them and teach them.
We spend a large portion of our time helping to support patients with chronic disease, whether that's cancer or not. And then we go all the way to the other side, which is supporting patients with nutritional care to help them with whatever – whether it's an ergogenic aid for sports, whether they're just run down and fatigued – because we know that vitamin C, we cannot make vitamin C in our own cells, so we need to supply it from the outside and take it in with our food. Well, we know that most of us have been eating a Standard American Diet, which certainly is not going to provide enough vitamin C to help fight off any infections, and so we need to supplement. And then sometimes that supplementation needs to go even higher. And with the IV doses, the reason why IV vitamin C is so powerful is because you can get exponential doses inside the cell. You skip the GI tract so you don't have any worry or trouble with any kind of loose bowels that might happen from oral dosing, and you are really quenching this free radical damage that happens when you have inflammation.
All disease is basically oxidative reduction and you're donating and receiving electrons. And so this powerful, natural nutrient that is provided for us, it's almost too good to be true. And so I think that's part of the resistance of, ""it can't possibly be all those things."" 
And so we talked earlier about how much of your life is our experiences, things that people told you and that you learned, or that you have seen and experienced for yourself. And so I grew up watching people get well, and now I'm taking care of those patients and have the luxury of being able to watch and have these patients get well in front of me and under my care. So it's really not... we don't go to work here. We really have the most fun because it's really incredible to watch someone turn around and feel so much better. And, everything isn't just in the same day, let's be realistic here, and it didn't take us a day to get sick. 
But my goal is to help share this information of the power of vitamin C. The dose is dependent on the amount of inflammation that's in the body. It's something that's non-toxic, it's very inexpensive. It's here for our use and I see a future that it becomes standard of care and that it's used from the moment we walk into the hospital until we get out sooner, because of it.
So, I've had my dad's experience and he lives next door to me. I still confer with him. I talk to him every day, and I really do have an incredible life, and my journey here is a lot different than a lot of other doctors who have been dismayed by conventional medicine and dismayed by this system. I do think there's a place for both. The words that we use around this type of medicine seem to always polarize, and it's really an all-encompassing [approach], as you brought up in the beginning, it's really about treating the whole patient. And so that includes the mental health, giving people hope instead of destroying their hopes and dreams, and letting them know that once you can change your thoughts, and we support the mechanical side or the chemical side by donating those electrons, you can start to feel better. And it's just sort of that merry-go-round of getting better and improving every single day. 
So, I kind of got vague there, but the power of vitamin C is so strong and the resistance that we feel – if we could let go of our past. I don't know why it's so unbelievable for people, if all they need to do is come here and sit on the couch and watch what happens.
And so we're having really good success with viral illnesses, as you can imagine. We've treated hundreds of patients. What they're recognizing is that it isn't going to be solved in one treatment, but that with 2 or 3 days of supporting the system, you give their body that little leg up and then it does its job.

So a little bit about Julie Matthews. She's a certified nutrition consultant and published researcher specializing in complex neurological digestive and immune conditions, most notably, autism. She is the author of the award-winning book, Nourishing Hope for Autism, and co-author of a study providing the efficacy of nutrition and dietary intervention for autism, published in the peer review journal Nutrients. Julie's approach is based on the personalized nutrition needs of each person and stems from her 20 years of clinical nutrition experience and research. Her methodology of BioIndividual Nutrition® helps individuals and practitioners who work with a wide range of disorders for adults and children improve health and healing. Julie has a private nutrition practice in San Francisco, California, and supports families and clinicians from around the world with her nutrition learning tools and professional training courses. For more information, you can actually reach her at NourishingHope.com and BioIndividualNutrition.com. 
But let's go right into getting this information, because it's very valuable and very interesting. So Julie, welcome. 
Julie Matthews: Thank you, Rebekah. I'm so glad to be here. 
Rebekah Kelley: It's so great to have you. I just want to jump right into the questions and get right to the good stuff. So what do you mean by personalized nutrition? I've heard that term, but what does it really mean? 
Julie Matthews: Yeah, this is a great question because most people think, ""Oh, of course, you know, I do nutrition, so it's personalized nutrition,"" but nutrition has changed a lot over the years. In personalized nutrition, we're getting very specific about being able to tailor the diet and nutritional needs to the person. So when I think about it, I think about bio-individuality, or biochemical individuality, and looking at each person's unique underlying factors – environment, biochemistry, genetics – and tailoring the diet and nutrition choices very specifically to them.
So instead of one diet, you know, you always hear about the diet of the day, right? Maybe one year it's this, one year it's that. But the truth is that those diets all have something valuable for somebody, which is why those people are so passionate about that diet. But then for every person that I would see where that diet would be helpful, there'd be somebody that that diet wasn't helpful for. And so I really learned as I was working with people that you really need to tailor the therapeutic diet, or combination of therapeutic diets, to the unique needs of that individual. So really that's what personalized nutrition is looking at, all of those different factors, and then customizing the diet and nutrition approach very specifically.
Rebekah Kelley: But how did you discover this? How did you discover the power of personalized nutrition? 
Julie Matthews: So, I'm a certified nutrition consultant and actually a published researcher, as well. And when I was working with clients, I started to realize that, as I was kind of saying, one person would come in and they'd get great results with a diet and another person would come in and they wouldn't.
My specialty is actually autism. And so I had a very core group of people that I was working with where I could very specifically look at this one group of people and learn everything about 10 of... of course, again, everybody's unique and everybody has different factors, but I was able to look at this one condition, and these people that were part of this had kind of one set of symptoms, and really look at what helped them and what didn't. And then I would figure out, okay, well, when did this particular diet help these people, under what circumstance, what underlying factors, what common symptoms did they have that improved, and which ones didn't, and why? And so I discovered really early on that there wasn't one diet for everybody, that everybody was unique. Even within this one condition, everybody was so different, and I was able to see when to use a diet for which person. And when I was able to tailor a diet to the individual needs of that person, I saw really, really great results. And so that's what had me seeing that everybody was unique and really needed this unique approach.
Rebekah Kelley: Wow. Now, are there some basic principles that work across individuals, or one diet that's best, or is it truly completely unique and very different? 
Julie Matthews: Oh, you have a very good point there. There are some things that are typically similar among most people. Again, once I say that, there are going to be outliers. For example, usually vegetables are really good. We might need to tailor which vegetables somebody can tolerate. Some people can't handle FODMAPs. Some people can't handle salicylates. Some people can't handle oxalates. Some people do best with the carnivore diet. But for the most part, most of us do well getting good vegetables in our diet. 
So that's a principle. Getting organic food, getting out the junk food, the artificial additives, food colors, artificial flavors, preservatives, taking out MSG, genetically modified foods, pesticides. Humans don't do well with things that aren't natural because we weren't made to be able to tolerate them. So that's usually something that's good for most of us, getting those good organic vegetables in. 
Getting good quality animal foods usually are beneficial for most of us because they have all the amino acids we need that can help with growth and repair. And we want to make sure they're as nutrient-dense as possible and free of all of the additives. So we want them to be pasture-raised, raised in a way where they're going to be as healthy as they can be.
Getting good fats for the brain is really going to be beneficial. And I like a wide range – some fish oils, some animal fats, some plant-based fats. Again, everybody's going to have a bit of a different ratio of what they need, but overall, getting good quality protein, fats and vegetables is good for most of us.
And then we can tailor it from there. As I said, maybe some people are going to do better with a low salicylate diet, or a low histamine diet, or a low oxalate diet, or a low FODMAPs diet, or a grain-free diet. But yeah, there are some principles that generally I think that most of us can do and then we can customize it and personalize it from there.
Rebekah Kelley: Thank you. So when you are teaching parents or other individuals, or maybe even training practitioners, what dietary approaches do you teach? 
Julie Matthews: So I teach many of the ones I kind of alluded to there. So I'm looking at ones that are going to be... gluten-free is a big one, dairy-free is a place I often start out with. Gluten is very inflammatory to the gut and Dr. Alessio Fasano discovered zonulin, which is a protein that we have that regulates our gut and whether it's leaky, or whether it's nice and protects us from things that we don't want to get in and is properly permeable. And he found that gluten causes this zonulin protein to really create leaky gut in all of us, regardless of whether we're celiac or have a really strong reaction. So being careful of gluten, I think, is prudent for most of us. 
There's actually an interesting study on pregnant women and looking at how much gluten they had. I'm trying to remember the effect, but I remember it was, I think the borderline here was like one piece of bread or something, and found that women that had more gluten had children with more challenges. And I think it was a challenge related to their blood sugar. I'm forgetting the exact study results now, and I don't necessarily recommend eating a piece of bread every day, but the point was, the more people ate, the more challenges resulted. And so I think the less gluten that most of us can eat, the better.
So gluten-free diets, I find, especially with the population I work with – children with ADHD and autism – gluten-free is really important, and dairy-free. They are two of the most common inflammatory proteins. And then from there, I like to help people take kind of a step-by-step approach. You could go straight to the ketogenic diet, but it's a very restrictive diet. And if we don't need to go into ketosis and go all the way there and limit our carbohydrates that significantly, we can go step by step our way. So maybe we start with gluten-free, then maybe some people go to grain-free, then maybe they go to some of these diets, like a specific carbohydrate diet, which also takes out starches like potatoes, or maybe they need a paleo diet that takes out legumes.
And then maybe somebody might eventually need something like a ketogenic diet. But I like to teach people, I have a 12-step process to take them step by step through some of the easier diets, where people tend to have more challenges, and step up to if they need a more restrictive diet over time. And that way it's easier to see where your challenge lies and helps people not overly restricted their diet to get there. 
I also look at some of these plant-based compounds that can be very inflammatory, whether it's nightshades, or low solicitate diet – that's going to be grapes, berries, raisins, really wonderful nutrient-dense foods and spices – but if you can't process them, they can create headaches, hyperactivity and attentiveness challenges with irritability, and things like that. Or a low oxalate diet can cause a lot of inflammation in the gut and can actually disrupt and kill our beneficial bacteria. So we often think of, if we have a disrupted microbiome, the low FODMAPs diet, which I think is great. But sometimes we might even look at something like a low oxalate diet, as oxalates can also disrupt the microbiome, which a lot of people aren't aware of. We often think of oxalates associated with kidney stones. 
So these are some of the principles, and there are more diets and things, but I like to customize the diet to the individual based on really understanding what's going on with them and helping to tailor that diet.

Rebekah Kelley: So I just want to jump right in and learn more, and I would like to know of course, right away, how do food and nutrition impact ADHD and autism? 
Julie Matthews: Well, when we look at, I think the best place to start is what is underlying ADHD and autism. Cause a lot of times we hear food and diet make no difference for these conditions. And that's absolutely not true. And if we understand what's going on underneath the system, it'll make a lot more sense. 
So ADHD and autism are neurological conditions. They're not psychological disorders, they are neurological conditions where the body, the biochemistry of the body affects the brain. I like to think about it as whole body disorders, where, when we understand what's happening with the biochemistry of the whole body, we can influence what's happening in the brain. So they're not these kind of behavioral disorders necessarily, or these mysterious brain conditions, they're really whole body conditions.
And so when we look at it that way, we know that their digestion is affected. We know that their microbiome is different, and often in a negative way that influences their brain. Their immune system can be either weak in certain ways or hyper-reactive in certain ways. And when we look at that, there are things that we can do by addressing food and nutrients to influence and improve their learning, their behavior, and their overall health, as well.
Rebekah Kelley: Wow. So, what is bio-individual nutrition and how does it help? 
Julie Matthews: So bio-individual nutrition is a term that I use for the type of nutrition that I practice, and it's really personalized nutrition. And I developed it from really decades of working with families with autism and ADHD, but also related disorders. A lot of family members have depression or anxiety, or auto-immune conditions, or digestive disorders. And I realized as I was working with the child with autism, let's say, it started to help the mother that was 70 pounds overweight, or the father that had an autoimmune condition, or the uncle or sibling who had an auto-immune or some other type of digestive issue, or whatever it might be.
And so really, it's understanding that each of us are unique and we all have unique dietary and nutritional needs. And so, there are interesting studies done looking at this and seeing that even in identical twins, the way we processed foods is only about 50% influenced by our genes and then 50% influenced by our environment, and factors like sleep and stress and things.
So there's a couple things there. One, if you're in the same family and you have similar genetics, you're going to find that similar diets probably do help. But even within that, you might find that even individual family members might need slight tweaks or changes to their diet, and certainly, what helps one child with autism is going to be very different than the diet that helps another child with autism. And so I discovered as I was working with families that this, the diet of the day, I could tell you from the beginning, it was first, it was gluten-free and dairy-free, and then it was a low salicylate diet, and then it was, maybe a grain-free diet, like a specific carbohydrate diet.
Now these are all great diets because they help certain people significantly, based on what was going on biochemically for them. But what would help one client really turned out to be maybe even not only not helpful, but maybe a problem for somebody else. And they needed a different approach, but they would go on to, let's say some of these social media forums and the advocates of the diet would say, well, you're just not doing it good enough. You're not doing it hard enough. You're not doing it right. You need to do it more strictly. And then they would try even harder and cause major stress in the process. But also, it wasn't the right diet for them, so they would be getting NOT better. Sometimes they would be getting worse.
So I started to realize, after about 20 years of working with families, what symptoms are common with which food compound, which underlying biochemistry was common and affected the ability to process certain food compounds, and which diets did different people need. And I created this body of knowledge that I now refer to as the practice of BioIndividual Nutrition. 
Rebekah Kelley: Love that. Perfect for our online podcast. So what is good nutrition for ADHD and autism? Obviously, there's going to be some individual differences. But is there like a base? 
Julie Matthews: Absolutely. We know from decades of research and study, and also parents and doctors experienced that, for example, artificial ingredients are really a factor in ADHD. We know from studies, even more recent studies done in, I think, 2015 or so, recent studies looking at artificial additives causing hyperactivity in neuro-typical children. So not even children with ADHD that might have an underlying biochemistry or propensity for a reaction, but finding that just your average child will react and get hyperactive from artificial dyes and additives.
So we know that to be a factor. And we know that people with ADHD and autism have underlying biochemistry, such as poor sulfation, and methylation and some other processes, transsulfuration, that affect their ability to process these additives even further. So they're more likely, in addition, to maybe get a little hyperactive, maybe get aggression, irritability, attention issues, all sorts of different things.
So getting out the junk food, the additives, MSG, those types of things, are really important. We also know that pesticides are very commonly a problem. We've seen studies on pregnant women that get exposed to pesticides have higher rates of children with ADHD and autism. And we know pesticides are a neurotoxin. And so if they're going to kill the bug quickly, but they're going to damage our neurological system still, just more slowly. So we want to avoid things like that. 
We want to get good, healthy nutrient-dense foods, no matter who we are. I mean, we know that from babies to adults, we want to have healthy food that's going to be rich in vitamins and nutrients. 
So those are some of the things that I think apply to everybody. Getting some good quality protein in the diet. Those are all going to be good factors. And then from there, people can go and individualize their diet, depending on what they do. 
Rebekah Kelley: So what, kind of when it gets to being like a therapeutic diet, are there things that can be done to help improve learning, mood, behavior? And if so, how do you personalize a diet for someone? How do you go about that process of figuring out what's really going to be helpful?
Julie Matthews: Well, that's a really good question. I think there's a couple things we can look at. Let me start with actually, just some of the basics that anybody might look at.
We did a study that was published in the Journal of Nutrients back in 2017, looking at what factors influenced and improved people with autism. And so we looked at a multivitamin-mineral formula and essential fatty acid blend with some fish oil and some other fatty acids, looking at digestive enzymes, a few other nutrients, and a healthy gluten-free, dairy-free and soy-free diet. And we found not only improvements in autism symptoms, digestive symptoms, we found that they improved their ADHD symptoms, their attention, their focus, their mood. We found really amazing changes, including to almost seven points in nonverbal IQ and four and a half times the developmental age improvement.
So let's just start with some of the kinds of things we found, generally speaking. And so this was for autism, but we found improvements in attention, focus, cognitive improvements, anxiety, depression. In these individuals with autism, these similar things can also be found in all children and children with ADHD, as well.
So some things that people can do – getting good nutrients in their diet or getting a multivitamin-mineral formula that's high quality is really a benefit. Getting out the artificial stuff, cause we look at a healthy, gluten-free, dairy-free and soy-free diet. Then of course, removing or looking at removing, gluten, dairy and soy can be really powerful, as well. We know that they're inflammatory to the gut. We know that people with ADHD and autism have more inflammation. They often have inflammation in the gut. They often have dysbiosis in the gut. So these food proteins can really be a problem. And I think that's one of the many reasons why we see improvements.
Also they can be, they can create opiate compounds. So things like, similar to morphine or heroin – those are opiates. They fit in the opiate receptor. They might stimulate them a little bit less strongly, but they stimulate them nonetheless, so they can be very addictive foods. You'll find that kids often gravitate towards all cheese, milk, bread – things that are filled with gluten and dairy – and they can create a lot of symptoms and reactions. So one of the diets I like to look at is a gluten-free, dairy-free and soy-free diet. 
And then from there, I mentioned salicylates – or I mentioned, sulfation, early on when we were talking about artificial additives. Well, there's natural phenol compounds too, that are called salicylates and they can occur in things like fruit, like grapes and berries and ketchup. And again, these, especially the berries and things, they can be very healthy foods, but if you don't process them, which we know is a factor in ADHD and autism, the research shows they have poor sulfation and we've known this for many decades. And when they can't process them, they get hyperactive, red cheeks, red ears, irritability, aggression, and a lot of different challenges. And so sometimes a low salicylate diet can be really helpful. 
Now, my goal is always to try to address the underlying factors so that we can eat as many of these foods as possible in the future. They have good qualities to them, but in the short term, or the medium term, until we can get things balanced a bit, it can really make a profound difference. 
And then we can't go into all of them today, but things I like to teach parents in my program are looking at low histamine, low ammine, low glutamate, low oxalate, low FODMAP diet. Now not everybody is going to need or could even possibly do all of these diets, but looking at which diet is going to meet the needs of which individual. Grain-free diets – grains can be very inflammatory to the gut. So I like to look at those different diets and then tailor them based on the symptoms they have, what's going on underneath, what underlying factors are happening, what conditions they or family members might have, to help them to tailor a bio-individual diet or a personalized diet for them.

A little bit about Julie Matthews. She is a Certified Nutrition Consultant and published researcher specializing in complex neurological, digestive and immune conditions, most notably autism. She is the author of the award-winning book, Nourishing Hope for Autism, and co-author of a study, ""Proving the Efficacy of Nutrition and Dietary Intervention for Autism,"" published in the peer reviewed journal Nutrients. Julie's approach is based on the personalized nutrition needs of each person and stems from her 20 years of clinical nutrition experience and research. Her methodology of bio-individual nutrition helps individuals and practitioners who work with a wide range of disorders for adults and children improve health and healing. 
Julie, thank you so much for being here with us. 
Julie Matthews: Thanks, Rebekah. I'm really glad to be here. 
Rebekah Kelley: So you practice bio-individual nutrition. Can you tell us what that is? 
Julie Matthews: Yes, so bio-individual nutrition is... bio-individuality is really biochemical individuality. So it's looking at an individual on their personal level of what's going on with their biochemistry in their body. So it's really personalized nutrition and it's really just looking at what's going on for them underneath and helping to really individualize it for the person. And so I would get very detailed into, what is their biochemistry, what health conditions do they have, what symptoms, reactions, all of those things, so that we can create a customized diet and nutrition plan that's very specifically for them. 
Rebekah Kelley: Awesome. So what is a low FODMAP diet? 
Julie Matthews: So it is, FODMAPs is an acronym for a variety of different fermentable carbohydrates. So, things like fructose and oligosaccharides, disaccharides, and polyols, things like that. Monosaccharides. And different ones are problematic for different people. Some of them are monosaccharides, but there's a challenge absorbing them. In other cases with disaccharides, it's a problem breaking them down into their primary components, their monosaccharides. Or it could be these longer chain carbohydrates, things like what's in beans or onions, these longer chains. And these fermentable carbohydrates have done to them what it sounds like, they get fermented, and they are fermented by bacteria. So when we don't have the right bacteria and microbiome in the right place, then when we ferment, when our microbiome ferments these carbohydrates, it can create a lot of symptoms – gas, pain, bloating, diarrhea, constipation, depending on the person.
Rebekah Kelley: It sounds like from some of the things that you've listed, that these actually can be considered healthy foods, like beans are considered healthy foods, but it's just that it just doesn't work with that individual. It creates problems for that individual. 
Julie Matthews: Absolutely. And some of the tricky part to that is that some of the best foods for feeding the microbiome, like beans, are some of the things that cause a problem for certain people. And so it gets a little tricky because some people might need to work on promoting some of the beneficial bacteria, but when they try to do that, they get symptoms. And so sometimes dysbiosis isn't always that you have pathogens. It could be, you have too much of a good bacteria, but in the wrong place, or something like that. So, absolutely, these are good foods. We don't necessarily want to limit them for everybody, but we do need to maybe reduce them or limit them maybe for a period of time, or for certain ones for certain individuals, because they just don't work for them.
Rebekah Kelley: So that kind of ties into the next question. When is a low FODMAPs diet beneficial? 
Julie Matthews: Usually I find it most beneficial when someone is dealing with digestive issues. There are some really good studies that have been done on Crohn's and colitis out of Australia looking at these particular foods, we'll call them foods, or these compounds in foods. And so we've seen a lot of good research on that. There's also information related to a lot of practitioners using this diet with SIBO, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, where we're saying that there's the good bacteria, but there's too much of it in the small intestine. The bacteria that's supposed to be more in the colon is more in the small intestine and that can create a lot of these symptoms we're talking about.
So I tend to like to look at that diet when someone's dealing with digestive issues that they can't figure out, or they're looking for one of the potential diets that might be able to help with digestive issues. So lots of those symptoms we talked about - gas, bloating, diarrhea, constipation. It might be alternating back and forth, so it's hard for them to figure out what's going on. But I often find a lot of painful gas, kind of trapped gas, those sorts of reactions. 
Rebekah Kelley: So you mentioned... but what's the research on the low FODMAP diet? 
Julie Matthews: Yeah, so, we go into some of that. I'm just going to write down for myself some notes as we go here. The research really should, looking into it... the good thing about this diet is that we see some of that research. So, we could dive into a little bit of it. I think that there's two things that are good and important here. One is kind of the anecdotal evidence of what practitioners... there's some great practitioners out there. Dr. Alison Siebecker doing great work, and Dr. [Mark] Pimintel doing work with SIBO and looking at diets, like the low FODMAPs diet, and doing their own clinical work and clinical research in that area, whether it's published or not. Some is, some isn't. There are different practitioners doing some really great research and really looking at IBS, inflammatory bowel issues, or irritable bowel issues – but also inflammatory bowel conditions like what I was saying, colitis, Crohn's disease, and there's some really good information on that. Some people do combine the diet with other diets. So that's kind of where I like to think about the bio-individual nutrition aspects.
So for me, doing what I do, I might bring these low FODMAP principles into a diet plan, into a personalized diet plan with somebody. So I might say, okay, this person is having these digestive issues, maybe we'll start with the low FODMAP diet. Maybe that's not enough. Then I might bring in some of the principles of something like a specific carbohydrate diet, where, because what's interesting in these two diets, FODMAP removes the sort of medium chain carbohydrates, whereas the specific carbohydrate diet removes disaccharides and long chain polysaccharides, like starches. FODMAPs brings in monosaccharides, a little disaccharides, but then also these medium chains that are not addressed in this other diet.
So I think it's really sometimes beneficial to combine diet principles and maybe they need to do two diets or maybe they need to bring in a few principles from this one diet into another. Looking at some of that in terms of studies and things, usually the diet will be done removing all the food categories.
But the thing about the low FODMAPs diet is not everybody reacts to all the categories. Some people we know in the research with autism, some people have carbohydrate digesting enzyme problems, and some people have fructose malabsorption. I know, I tend to do a lot with autism, so I know that research off the top of my head. And so for them, they might have more of this issue with FODMAPs, whereas somebody else might have more of an issue with something else. So again, it's bringing in that personalized aspect. With that research, when we kind of step beyond it, we go kind of more into the clinical setting, we then might want to see, okay, did removing those FODMAPs help? But then on a clinical perspective, we want to look at which ones do they need to avoid. Some people might just have more of an issue with the oligosaccharides, for example, and then just need to really avoid the beans and things. Or they might need to avoid some of the fructo oligosaccharides in probiotic supplements, cause those really get them. Other people might have more of an issue with the fructose and those things. So it's, again, even within a FODMAPs diet, I feel like we want to do that bio-individual aspect of it because we don't always need to avoid all of them all the time.

Rebekah Kelley: Welcome to the Humanized podcast, all about personalizing your health. I am your host, Rebekah Kelley, and today we'll be discussing Oxalates: How Healthy Foods Can Hurt, with Julie Matthews. Before I introduce Julie, I want to remind everyone to subscribe, to get all of our variety of casts in audio, video and transcription at HumanizedHealth.com. I'd also like to thank our lead sponsor, Village Green Apothecary, at MyVillageGreen.com. 
Our special guest is Julie Matthews and we'll discuss what oxalates are and how they can be quite high in some popular diets like vegan and paleo. Julie Matthews is a certified nutrition consultant and published researcher specializing in complex neurological, digestive and immune conditions, most notably autism. She is the author of the award-winning book, Nourishing Hope for Autism, and co-author of a study, ""Proving the Efficacy of Nutrition and Dietary Intervention for Autism,"" published in the peer review journal, Nutrients. Julie's approach is based on the personalized nutrition needs of each person and stems from her 20 years of clinical nutrition experience and research. Her methodology of BioIndividual Nutrition helps individuals and practitioners who work with a wide range of disorders for adults and children improve health and healing. 
So, Julie, thank you so much for being here with us.
Julie Matthews: Thank you. I'm glad to. 
Rebekah Kelley: So you use BioIndividual Nutrition, which is a personalized nutrition, which is humanized health, which is why we're all here, in approaching your practice. And so, how does a low oxalate diet fit in?
Julie Matthews: So to me, there are some principles of diet that are probably good for a lot of people – eat whole foods, eat organic. But then there are other things that really are personalized to the individual. So something like oxalates is not something everybody needs to, let's say, be on a low oxalate diet. But I do like to share it with people because it's surprising how often, well, it's surprising, I run into a lot of people that have an oxalate issue that aren't necessarily aware of it. And that's partly because in the world of oxalates, the scientists only recently started to realize that you could have an issue with oxalates outside of kidney stones. And so now, as we're realizing much more about it, that we can get into, we're really realizing that it can be a factor for a lot of people. I don't want to say a lot, but it can be a factor for some people. And so they might benefit in reducing oxalates, and the level they reduce them is very personalized.
So I feel that too many oxalates, an overabundance of oxalates, is not really good for most of us, but some people really need to go on a low oxalate diet. So that's where some people might bring in these low oxalate principles, or just even having awareness of oxalates and maybe not go too overboard because you'll realize that there's a lot of ""health foods"" that are quite high in oxalates that may not be doing everybody all the good that they're hoping for.
Rebekah Kelley: So since we're talking a lot about oxalates, what are oxalates and can you give us an example of foods that have them, that might be high in an oxalate? 
Julie Matthews: Absolutely. So oxalate is this molecule that, in nature, binds to calcium and magnesium and other things. Used by plants to, as basically a bug deterrent, a pesticide, so that the bugs don't eat the plants. And when they get into our body, that's when they can form into crystals and create things like kidney stones. So foods high in oxalates are things like spinach, nuts. So to give you an example, the average person eats maybe a hundred milligrams, 150 milligrams of oxalate a day. A low oxalate diet would be more in the 50 range, 40 to 60 kind of range. One serving of spinach has 500 milligrams. And one quarter cup of almond flour has 450. So you can see how fast, especially when you have people that are on these smoothie diets, or, a green smoothie every day... there are green smoothies that are good, so don't get me wrong. But if they're putting spinach in it every day, it wouldn't be advantageous. Or they're on a paleo diet and they're eating a lot of nut flours because they're trying to avoid grains. So again, a paleo diet or even a vegan diet that might be high in a lot of vegetables, it's not inherently going to be high oxalate, but if you're not aware, you can easily go overboard on oxalates.
Rebekah Kelley: So Popeye was definitely OD'ing on oxalates. 
Julie Matthews: Definitely. [Laughing]
Rebekah Kelley: So what does it mean that oxalates are anti-nutrient? I mean, is that true? I mean, certainly when you say spinach, do you think about it as being high in nutrients. You wouldn't think of that as being an anti-nutrient. That seems very nutrient dense to me. 
Julie Matthews: Exactly. It's a strange thing for most people to wrap their head around, but even in the days of Popeye, actually, back in the '30s, we knew there were studies done on spinach being anti-nutrient. So apparently the cartoon makers weren't aware of that [laughs], I don't know. 
So, the research on oxalate is really interesting. And so an anti-nutrient is something that, as you said, would sort of take nutrients away from you, rather than be nutrient rich. Now, it's rich in nutrients, but as I said, because it can bind to things like calcium... not all high calcium foods are high oxalate, but many high oxalate foods are high calcium because nature is binding that oxalate to the calcium. So if you just look at the calcium levels of things, you'll see a lot of high calcium foods that are also high oxalate, like spinach. The challenge is that you're not able to access or utilize the calcium that's in that spinach because it's so high in oxalate that it binds up all of the calcium, making it unusable. 
So they did some studies and they looked at rats and they found that if they fed them... I won't go into too much detail, but basically, they gave them a diet that was deficient in calcium. And then they gave them a diet deficient in calcium but had the extra made up with spinach. And they found that those that had the full amount of calcium, but half of it was from spinach, those had some significant nutrient deficiency. Their bone quantity and quality was significantly lower than the ones that were just deficient, because what they find is that the oxalate binds to not only that calcium in the spinach, but the calcium in the rest of the meal and the minerals in the rest of the meal, making that food, making a lot of those important minerals not usable. 
So that's really the issue with spinach or with high oxalate foods. And I find it interesting that even though we've known that for decades, we collectively don't acknowledge that, for whatever reason. Or aren't aware of that, maybe is a better way to put it.
Rebekah Kelley: So what negative effects can oxalates then have in the body, if this is happening, if calcium being bound up? What can happen? 
Julie Matthews: So for some people, the issue is that it's binding to their minerals. And so they're just going to be eating foods and they're not going to be getting the nutrients they want. But for other people that have a more significant issue with oxalate, if we are deficient in certain B vitamins, we can actually produce oxalate inside the body. So that's called endogenous oxalate. Rather than it coming from the diet, we can also produce it internally. And when that happens, then we can get a lot of issues cause it's right there in the cells. Also, if we're deficient in certain nutrients, it can get inside the cell when it wouldn't have otherwise. So certain vitamin deficiencies and mineral deficiencies can cause the oxalate to get inside the cell. And when it's in there, we can get mitochondrial damage. It can globally cause challenges. 
What are some of the other things – I'll go into some of the symptoms that that can lead to in a second, when we get to that – inflammation, oxidative stress, it can damage the bacteria of our body. So we need that good bacteria to break oxalate down, but when we have too much oxalate, we also don't have the good bacteria we need. So sometimes people say, oh, just, just get more probiotics in your diet. Well, if you've already got high oxalate, you're going to be killing off, potentially killing off that good bacteria. So we might need a bit of a different approach there. 
Rebekah Kelley: So what are the symptoms? 
Julie Matthews: So one of the big ones is fatigue. And the other really big one is pain. And that makes sense – if they are very inflammatory, they create a lot of oxidative stress. They can create damage in the gut, but they can create damage throughout the body. And because they can impair mitochondrial function, they can create a lot of fatigue. So those are two of the biggest things I see.
Oxalates also damage, or sorry, they trigger the inflammasome. And the inflammasome is what it sounds like, it creates inflammation. And it creates chronic ongoing inflammation. So for people with autoimmune conditions, one of the big conditions that occurs with the inflammasome being activated is autoimmune conditions. And some of the symptoms of autoimmune conditions? Inflammation, fatigue, pain. So, what comes first or how they're related, it might be different for each person, but certainly we don't want to add fuel to a fire. So I think that's just something interesting to be aware of.
And there can be other challenges as well, but I think those are two of the big ones.

Our special guest, Julie Matthews, will discuss histamine and how our diet can play a big role in elevated levels in the body. A little bit about Julie Matthews before we get going. She is a certified nutrition consultant and published researcher specializing in complex neurological, digestive and immune conditions, most notably autism. She is the author of the award-winning book, Nourishing Hope for Autism, and co-author of a study, ""Providing the Efficacy of Nutrition and Dietary Intervention for Autism,"" published in the peer review journal, Nutrients.

Julie, thanks for being here with us. 
Julie Matthews: Thank you. 
Rebekah Kelley: So Julie, let's just jump right in. What is histamine and tell me, how does it affect our bodies? 
Julie Matthews: So histamine is a molecule that we find in the mast cells. If we think of allergies and all of the inflammation, it depends where it's located, but that sort of inflammatory response that happens when we come in contact with something we don't tolerate or are allergic to, we get this inflammatory response. And histamine, basically, is one of the substances in these mast cells that gets released and can cause all different kinds of symptoms throughout the body. It's not just when we think of allergies, runny nose and things like that. It can create all different symptoms in different parts of the body including, we have them in the stomach and for some people that might create GERD type symptoms, other people might get inflammation, some people might get hives. So it can be different symptoms for different people, but it's basically something that, when we come into contact with something that the immune system is not happy with, it will release this chemical compound, basically. 
Rebekah Kelley: So what foods are high in histamine? Can you give me some examples of some that people have?
Julie Matthews: Yes. So histamine is found in often things that are broken down or fermented, things like bone broths, sauerkraut, canned fish, cured meats, salami, anything like beer, wine, anything with yeast, you know, anything like that. So foods like that are some of the ones that are going to be the highest in histamines. 
Rebekah Kelley: Wow. So what is histamine intolerance, then? What does that look like? 
Julie Matthews: So what's interesting about histamine intolerance... We normally think of when we don't react well to a food that we have a sensitivity to it, like allergic to eggs or sensitive to gluten or something. But with histamine, what's interesting, it's more of an intolerance, which means that we can only handle so much of it before it overloads our capacity to process it, and then we have a reaction to it. So histamine intolerance is basically an inability to handle the load of histamine that our body has. 
Rebekah Kelley: So that can be tricky then. So if you have one egg and you're fine, but you have three eggs and suddenly you have an issue, you think it's not an egg, it's something else. But it could be that egg. 
Julie Matthews: Absolutely. Depending on, again, what's causing that. So if someone had an allergy and their histamine reaction was from an allergy, then it might not matter how many eggs they had. But absolutely something else, for example – let's take bone broth. Some people might be able to handle a slow-simmer bone broth that's only done for a couple hours on a low temperature because not that much histamine is created, where if they have a 24-hour long-simmer bone broth, they might have an issue, there's more histamine. Or if their body, some people tend to have more kind of high histamine in their body, depending on how their methylation works. So some people tend to already be kind of on the borderline, where they, let's say it's allergy season. So they've got more allergies in their system, and then they're eating foods that are higher histamine. Or even one of the tricky things with histamine is that you can eat histamine liberating foods. So they might not have high histamine, but they can liberate histamine. 
So yes, it's kind of this total amount of histamine that might be in our body through a combination of our methylation and genetics, our environment, and what we're eating. So yes, from that perspective, it is a little bit complicated. It's a little bit about how much load can we tolerate. 
Rebekah Kelley: So then how does someone know if they have a histamine intolerance since it seems kind of sneaky in a way. 
Julie Matthews: It is, kind of. There are some labs and things that people can do, some markers and things, but usually one of the ways for the average person that's out there, that's just kind of wondering as they're listening to this, there's a couple things. So, I would say... I was going to go with the food thing first, but there are maybe some clues. So, do you tend to have some of that higher allergy response? Do you tend to have a little more allergies to begin with? That might be a little clue. Sometimes people, when they scratch their skin, if it makes a big red mark that, inflammation there, sometimes that's some histamine. 
But usually what I use, as a nutrition person, what I'm looking at is, how does somebody react to foods? So that's usually where I go. There are all sorts of other ways that doctors can look at histamine levels and histamine reactions, but I'm looking at foods. So when somebody eats, how do they do when they eat some of the foods I mentioned, whether it's, again, bone broth and sauerkraut... A lot of times we've talked about healthy foods that a lot of people eat thinking they're going to be healthier eating them, and they are great foods. I love these foods, but if you're eating a food and for you, you're not as healthy as you feel like you should be eating this ""healthy diet,"" or you feel like maybe you're getting a reaction, but you think, how could I be getting reaction to this ""health food"" when everybody else says, how great it is? I would really listen to that intuition there because it might be for you, that food isn't particularly helpful. 
So, you know, what I suggest is people do two things. One is have an awareness of some of these foods and just pay attention to how do you feel when you eat them.
But you brought up a good point, that there are so many factors and there are so many foods and ways you can get this overload, sometimes reducing the foods and seeing if you feel better, and then adding some of them back and see, do those symptoms come back, is a good way to get a better sense, because you have a little more contrast there in order to make that determination.

I'd also like to thank our lead sponsor Village Green Apothecary at MyVillageGreen.com. 
Our special guest, Julie Matthews, will discuss the low salicylate diet and how salicylates can result in behavioral issues, sleep problems and more for those with sulfation issues. Julie Matthews is a certified nutrition consultant and published researcher specializing in complex neurological, digestive and immune conditions, most notably autism. She is the author of the award-winning book, Nourishing Hope for Autism, and co-author of a study, ""Providing Efficacy of Nutrition and Dietary Intervention for Autism,"" published in the peer reviewed journal, Nutrients. Julie's approach is based on the personalized nutrition needs of every person and stems from her 20 years of clinical nutrition experience and research. Her methodology of BioIndividual Nutrition helps individuals and practitioners who work with a wide range of disorders for adults and children improve health and healing.
Julie, thank you so much for being here. 
Julie Matthews: Thanks Rebekah. I'm glad to be here. 
Rebekah Kelley: So, how did you first start using the low – and I'm having a hard time with this word – salicylate diet in your nutrition practice? What foods are high in salicylates? 
Julie Matthews: Yes. So, it is a tricky one. I say it ""sa-li-cy-late,"" and it is confusing too, because salicylic acid, where it's sort of derived from, is also pronounced a little slightly differently. So, salicylates. But we know what you're talking about, so it's all good. 
My specialty is kids with ADHD and autism. A low salicylate diet has actually been used for people with ADHD since the 1970s with Dr. Ben Feingold. It's a really helpful diet when you have hyperactivity and attentiveness, things like that. Particularly I find it really great with hyperactivity. Also aggression, sleep issues, irritability, red cheeks, red ears, difficulty kind of calming down, slowing down at night. So, those are some of the places that I see it most helpful. 
So it first came about in my work when I was working with kids and just realizing how many of them have this underlying biochemistry that causes them to have issues with these food compounds. And we can go into more about what they are and where they're found, but that's how I came about it – it's been actually used for a really long time. And I see such amazing results in my practice, something so simple, making such a dramatic difference. I mean, a child with autism, with severe aggression, every single day aggression going to almost no aggression after removing some of these foods. I mean, it's a really life-changing thing and it's such a simple change, if that's what's going on for somebody. 
Rebekah Kelley: If you mentioned, I missed it – but what foods are high in salicylates? 
Julie Matthews: Salicylates are found in a lot of healthy foods. So this is again, something that makes it a little bit tricky. You know, it really is. We don't want to just remove all of these foods unless somebody's reacting. And so these ""polyphenol rich foods"" – and I say that in quotes because salicylates are a type of phenol. So when we look at these, a lot of people are familiar with polyphenol foods. They're things like apples and grapes and turmeric and cinnamon, and all of these really great fruits and vegetables and herbs and spices that are wonderfully anti-inflammatory and nutrient dense and all this great stuff. But if you are reacting to them, then they can create some biochemical chaos for those people that don't process them well.
Rebekah Kelley: And what does that biochemical chaos look like? What are those symptoms that are caused by these salicylates? 
Julie Matthews: Yeah, so it can, even though they're anti-inflammatory foods, it actually can create inflammation. Some people actually get hive-like symptoms, but they don't have an allergy to the food. They're having this inflammatory reaction. It can create digestive disturbances. But one of the big things I see is behavior and cognitive challenges associated. So, irritability. Some of those things I mentioned earlier that are some of the big ones for me – irritability, aggression, hyperactivity, sleeping challenges. But also the sort of classic red cheeks and red ears, they tend to do that. Now people will say, well, my child doesn't have red cheeks or red ears. You don't have to have all of these symptoms. You might just have a few of them. But red cheeks, red ears and hyperactivity are kind of some of the most common classic symptoms that I see, particularly in kids. Now, adults can get reactions as well, but adults' reactions might look a little different. So they might not have bedwetting, but they might have urinary frequency or something, or urgency, or something like that. So it might look different. 
Rebekah Kelley: Wow. So what symptoms are caused by salicylates and also why do people have salicylates intolerance? How does that translate? 
Julie Matthews: So the reason for these symptoms and this salicylate intolerance, I mean, it can be, obviously, a little different for different people, but it's often a challenge with sulfation chemistry. And so we don't have to go into all of that, but maybe some of your listeners have heard of methylation. We need methylation for transsulfuration, for then sulfation – there's like this whole, basically, cascade of biochemical processes. And sulfation is one of them that actually is an interesting marker for chronic disease. So Rosemary Waring and Margaret Moss did this study looking at and postulating that. Poor sulfation is a marker in all chronic disease. And so they found it not only to be an issue in autism and ADHD, but depression, IBS, all sorts of neurological conditions, lupus. So really, really interesting. When we don't have... Sulfation is required to process salicylates. So if sulfation is inadequate, then we can get this issue. And we don't have, necessarily, probably the ability to go into all of it, but people can always... I talk a lot about this. People can find out more. There are various reasons you might either be low in the building blocks of that, or be depleting that. And then, there are multiple ways to address it, but one of them that can provide some immediate relief is to look at a low salicylate diet.
Rebekah Kelley: So when you personalize a diet with your bioindividual nutrition approach, where does the low salicylate diet fit into this? 
Julie Matthews: So I think in a way, you know, since everything is individual, it will depend on the person. But I find that if I'm also looking at kids with behavioral challenges, this comes up pretty often for them because of the research we know about their underlying biochemistry. So I would say a vast majority of my clients with ADHD and autism, I would add this principle to their personalized nutrition plan because I find it to be so helpful for them. Obviously, I don't apply it across the board cause not everybody... but that's something that's going to be more common for them.
So I guess the way that I look at personalizing a diet is that I try to stick with some solid, good nutrition principles. Getting enough adequate protein, good quality grass-fed protein, getting some good quality vegetables, getting good fats for the brain. And then the types of foods might vary. So you might avoid certain high salicylate vegetables and certain high salicylate fruits, and you might focus on some of the other foods. So that's kind of how I would bring in a salicylates, or a low salicylates diet into a bioindividual nutrition approach.

Biochemmical Imbalances:
The Root Cause of Mental Health Disorders
Dr. Albert Mensah

Rebekah Kelley: Welcome to the Humanized Podcast, Your Health Personalized. I'm your host, Rebekah Kelley. Today we're going to be talking about the role of biochemical imbalances as the root cause of mental disorders. We have a great guest today, Dr. Albert Mensah. But before I introduce Dr. Mensah, I want to remind everyone to subscribe, to get all of our variety of casts in audio, video, and transcription at HumanizedHealth.com. I also like to thank our lead sponsor Village Green Apothecary at MyVillageGreen.com.

Our guest, Dr. Albert Mensah, specializes in treating mental health disorders through biochemical lab testing and individualized, targeted, nutrient therapy. He is the co-founder of Mensah Medical in Warrenville, Illinois, an integrative health clinic, as well as the Mensah Research Institute, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to conducting, supporting and presenting research that provides scientific evidence of the efficacy of targeted nutrient therapy. Dr. Mensah, thanks so much for being here.

Dr. Albert Mensah: My absolute pleasure. Thank you for having me.

Rebekah Kelley: I'd like to focus on your unique approach to mental health disorders. What is advanced nutrient therapy? I've got to admit, I haven't heard about this for mental health. I've seen many therapists and no one’s  ever mentioned this to me before. So this is new.

Dr. Albert Mensah: Well, it's new. And at the same time, it's old. Somewhere along the line medicine went in the wrong direction. It kind of left the direction it was going in originally. And that time came about, really, thanks to the great Dr. Lister, who invented Listerine. But it was actually more about his uncovering the truth about something called bacteria, a not-as-of-yet heard of strange, invisible creature that could cause people to become ill.

He presented this to surgeons and suggested that they should clean their equipment before surgeries and in-between surgeries. And they laughed at him. So these invisible things, blah, blah, blah. And then the microscope was invented. And guess what they found? Bacteria. Now, at that point in time, the world shifted from looking at internal causes, to the world of outside invaders.

But what we have to come back to is, why is the mind being affected this way in the first place? What we see is that most of the time, this idea of mental health has nothing to do with the mind at all. It starts with the brain.   Dysregulation in the brain, an inability for the pieces that all need to work together, not working, leads to emotional and cognitive challenges.
The way I like to put it is, if you own a car, you get in your car and anybody who knows you says, ""Oh, that's Rebekah coming down the street."" But if Rebekah is trapped in her car, and her car is on fire, nobody says, ""Rebekah is on fire."" They say, ""Her car’s on fire, she's trapped, and she can't get out!"" That's the world we operate in with regard to mental health.

That's when pharmacotherapy began. That's when drug developments began. So we left the world of what's wrong internally, to protecting ourselves from outside invaders. That was a big disservice. In the old days, a lot of that was called alchemy.

Now we're slowly coming back to these concepts of metals and dysregulations, using metals for treatment. Basically, looking at what's wrong, what the imbalances are in the system, as opposed to just saying, gosh, we don't know what it is. It's not a bacteria. It's not a virus. So we don't know.

Even the term ""mental health"" suggests we don't know – because the mind is a construct that incorporates everything from, depending on your religious beliefs, a soul, a heart, a lung, a kidney, the GI tract, and bacteria in the GI tract. All these things put together create emotional well-being, or non-emotional well-being, or emotional dysregulation.

But instead of saying, ""There's something wrong with Rebekah's car,"" we say, ""There's something wrong with Rebekah."" That's the wrong attitude.

What we've now come to understand, thanks to the work of, the great pioneer Carl Pfeiffer, and Linus Pauling, and Dr. William Walsh, who worked with Pfeiffer, is that there are actual biochemical imbalances. There are the things that go wrong in the system of the brain that lead to these emotional dysregulations. They lead to things like anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and ADHD, to say the least. How else are you going to end up with somebody who says, ""I have a wonderful life. I've got a wonderful spouse. I have finances. Everything was taken care of for me, but I'm depressed and I don't know why. I have no outside reason for depression.""

This is just one example. Where we're coming to now is getting back to where we were originally, before the outside invaders came into play. And now we've expanded upon that work and we've got great vision and understanding about cause and effect.

Rebekah Kelley: How effective is it then?

Dr. Albert Mensah: 85% on average. That's right. 85% on average.

Rebekah Kelley: Medication can't even promise that, right?

Dr. Albert Mensah: No, it can't. Because here's one of the differences. In order to do what we do, not only do we do a good personal history, but also a family history, a virtual biochemical genetic tree. And then we actually test. So we've got objective data that we work with. The world of psychiatry and psychology has no objective data. Basically, they say, "" Oh, gee, don't worry about the time your dog died. Then you'll be better in 32 hours...""

So now we're able to actually test. Then, based upon that testing and based on the history, we put together a solid protocol that addresses those chemical imbalances, using the very same natural parts that are problematic in the first place.

We don't sit around and say, ""Gosh, your car broke down again."" (I like cars, so I always go with a car analogy.) And nobody says, ""Let me talk to your car and maybe it'll start again."" What do you do?

You take the car into the shop. They diagnose the problem and they treat it. You take the human body into the shop, we just call it a hospital. They run tests; they identify the problem. Then they treat it. It's the same for the human brain. You've got to identify the problem, create a protocol around it and treat the condition. Same process standardized.

Rebekah Kelley: What are some common imbalances? What conditions do they lead to? How are they treated?

Dr. Albert Mensah: Let's just talk about some very common conditions. The most common conditions that almost any psychiatrist, psychologist or therapist is going to encounter will be anxiety and depression. Depression, big time. It can be seasonal. It can be a seasonal affective disorder. It can be depression that is major depression, stemming from a variety of causes. It can be depression that's situational. Now, situational depression, on the other hand, is more often than not, exactly what most people think, it's oftentimes more of a mental health issue. But depression that's been there for life, whether it's been there for decades or even several years, generally is not an issue of thinking. It is a problem in terms of the chemical imbalances that are present.

So anything from a methylation disorder to a zinc imbalance, or a copper dysregulation, or what we call pyrrole disorder. Everyone knows about vitamin D. Then of course there are a whole boatload of challenges, like thyroid conditions. These are just a few examples of some of the key imbalances that lead to these conditions.

Now what's also very important is the fact that it's not usually just one chemical imbalance. Most of the time it's a combination. This is why a lay person can't guess their way into helping themselves. You've got to know how these things work together, how they compound each other, and which one is actually the major chemical imbalance. These are just some of the examples of imbalances that can lead to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and things like that.

Rebekah Kelley: It's complicated. 

Dr. Albert Mensah: It is.

Rebekah Kelley: What role would diet play in all of this?

Dr. Albert Mensah: That's a great question. And it is a loaded question. Many people don't like the answer. But I'm not many people, and my job is to take care of you, and everybody else out there. Diet is not what we've been taught. Diet is not about lovely breakfast, lunch, dinner cereals, you know, blah, blah, blah. It's not that at all.

When you've got a mental health disorder, and we're just going to call it that for simple terms, you test. Existing chemical imbalances can be exacerbated by the wrong diet. But what many people do NOT want to hear is that a high vegetable diet can make you sicker, or even suicidal.

I get a tremendous amount of feedback. First there's shock. Then there's, ""Oh, but I don't like eating any other way."" I say, ""My job is to guide you. You do whatever you want to with that information."" But the fact is, for example, if you have a methylation disorder, foods that are rich in folates can actually make your methylation disorder worse. And where are folates present, predominantly? Dark green, leafy vegetables.

Let's say you've got a copper dysmetabolism. 35% of females with postpartum depression, depression anxiety, fibroid tumors, endometriosis, or chronic fatigue have a copper dysmetabolism. So let's look at the foods that are high in copper. You've got broccoli. You've got avocados. You've got kale.  Almonds. Sound familiar? These are all favorite foods in salads. So you sit down having your wonderful vegetarian life. For breakfast you have yada yada. For lunch you have a wonderful salad with avocados. For dinner you make sure you have the almonds and the broccoli. You are stacking copper upon copper upon copper into your diet.

That now worsens or exacerbates your anxiety, depression, your situation mentally. And you can't figure out what you're doing wrong. Well, it's not that you're wrong, it's just that you're sort of miscalculating. You don't know that you've got this metal dysmetabolism. Now, based upon testing, you can determine the better way to eat.

There are some things that are simply tried and true. Most people don't want to hear this; you are a machine. You're designed to operate in a certain way. You can feed your machine the right things, or you can feed it whatever you want and hope for the best. But if you are, for example, an undermethylated person, a high vegetable diet is not feeding your machine optimally. It can make you suicidal.

In another case, what about somebody who's got the opposite methylation disorder, maybe an overmethylated person. They are designed to eat tons and tons of dark green, leafy vegetables. But an undermethylated person is designed to be a carnivore.

The real irony, which I still haven't figured out in all these years, is that these two opposing chemistries just love to eat the exact opposite way. We've got our big, giant football players out there; overmethylated people are usually pretty thick because methyl leads to creatine, which leads to muscle. And these guys want to go out and eat beef. They want to go out and chop down a giant warehouse full of pterodactyls and T Rexes and cows. But they are the ones who should be eating a diet rich in vegetables, just rich in vegetables.

Now, on the other side of the equation, they want to eat vegetables and they should be eating more protein, animal protein. This is not about philosophy. This is simply about the science.

So diet can make things worse, but you usually can't eat your way purely into health. When you've got these biochemical imbalances, you need several times the recommended daily allowance of many nutrients. There’s no way you could eat that in a day. It'd be impossible. It's like an old commercial for Total cereal. You need 13 bowls of Total cereal to equal the amount of zinc in this one capsule. So that's the role food can play. It can be hurtful. It can be beneficial, but it's not always curative.

Rebekah Kelley: If you could wrap up and give us a summary of some takeaways based upon what you shared?

Dr. Albert Mensah: There are some key points here. Number one, I want people to understand that mental health is not about the mind, necessarily.   The vast majority of time, there are actual chemical imbalances. There are things that are wrong with the functioning of the brain that are fixable, that are causing these mental health disorders.

Number two, those things are testable. We can actually test for chemical imbalances and we can create a natural, or shall we say even nutraceutical grade approach to treating those conditions. But we are still using the natural elements that you were designed with. We're fixing the parts, as opposed to trying to wrap up duct tape around the parts of the car and hope things go well.

Number three, diet plays a very important role. Diet can be inflammatory. We didn't talk about that, but the wrong diet, based upon your chemistry, can make you worse. You may think you're eating all wonderful and great things that are out there for you, but you can become sicker, sicker, sicker, and suicidal. You've had patients like that. And all we do is find out that they're eating the wrong way. And then on the fun side, Rebekah, I didn't mention this before – I've seen many professional athletes that have found out though chemical testing that they were eating the wrong way. When they ate properly, wow! Their careers shot up in a major league, big direction.

Rebekah Kelley: My mind is blown. I'm just trying to process all that. Beautifully said. Thank you. Thanks so much, Dr. Mensah. Those are really valuable insights.

Albert Mensah: Thank you for the invitation Rebekah, delighted to be here.


Rebekah Kelley: I want to bring up the fact that people have so many questions about these new vaccines. Can you please provide us with an overview of the different vaccines currently available for COVID-19?

Albert Mensah: Certainly. I want people to understand something about me personally. I'm not an anti-vaxxer and I'm not a necessarily mandated pro- vaxxer. I'm an orthomolecular specialist who looks at what is needed and necessary at the time, for whatever the purpose is.

There are some vaccines you don't need at all. I think it's a waste of time and money. There are other vaccines you kind of say, oh no, you need that. I just want to be very clear, I have no stake in any of these vaccines nor investment or anything.

Now, we basically have two types of vaccines that are out. One type is what's called an mRNA vaccine; that's what you've heard about thus far with the two most prominent ones available in the United States.

The second group are what I call real or natural vaccines. What do I mean by that? To be careful and cautious, what we really have to say is that the mRNA vaccines are really genetic engineering. They are targeted, chemical injections that direct your body to function a very specific way.

And then we've got vaccines that are coming out, like the Johnson and Johnson vaccine and the AstraZeneca vaccine and the Novavax vaccine, that are traditional vaccines. They carry pieces of information that come from a viral particle, a virus, that gets injected into your system. Then your body recognizes it as foreign and develops antibodies to it. That's different than the mRNA vaccines, because those actually direct your system to make a protein that is to be recognized later on as foreign.

So there are two different processes going on. I'm not a fan of the first two. I want to be very clear – I don't like mRNA vaccines. Now having said that, I also have to share with you again, what we deal with is bio-individual medicine. We have to ask the question, ""Who are you?"" That determines what you need and what you do.

Right now, because of the huge efficacy, the huge capacity to do the job it needs to do, the mRNA vaccines are out. They are here. If you fall into certain categories, you need to get those vaccines. We all know about the frontline workers. We all know about senior citizens. If you work in a clinic, if you work in a nursing home, if you're a nursing home patient within a certain age category, go and get these vaccines done. There's simply no question about that.

But what if you're not a Tier 1 A, B or C, for example? What if you are maybe in your forties or fifties, you have no comorbid conditions, and you're not really exposed to much of anyone. Can you afford to wait until the other vaccines come out? You probably could. That is a question you have to discuss with your doctor, or with someone who's in the health profession.

You, as an individual, carry a tremendous history. You may have an underlying autoimmune disorder. You may have asthma. You may have rheumatoid arthritis. You may have diabetes or high blood pressure. Those variables change the determination of when you can do what you need to do. In other words, do you need to get a vaccine now? Or can you wait till later?

If you can wait until later, according to certain criteria, then our construct is, let's look at the more traditional vaccines for you. I don't want to talk about brand labels, but let's look at the ones that are just regular vaccines, not mRNA vaccines.

Rebekah Kelley: If you're going to wait for the more traditional vaccine, and you've determined that, is there anything that one needs to take into consideration? Is there any nutrition you need to think about? Is there anything that you need to take? Any perspectives related to that; or is it not relevant?

Albert Mensah: In actuality, it's not really quite so relevant. We're living in a very different time here. One of the reasons I can sit back and say, depending on who you are, you better go get that mRNA vaccine, even though I don't like them… if right now I were working in a heavily populated clinic or hospital, seeing tons and tons of people who have COVID, I would be getting the mRNA vaccine.  But sitting in my office and doing more telemedicine right now, or talking to people in general by the telephone, I can say I'm not necessarily in that category. And I can perhaps wait. But for people who, say, have been exposed, my perspective may be a little bit different. 

But in terms of diet and food and things like that, what we like to say is you should be optimizing your diet during this point of time anyway. For those who may not believe me, we've got videos on YouTube at MensaMedical.com that talk about diet and COVID, that talk about utilizing and optimizing your nutrients around you, your vitamin C, your zinc, your vitamin D and melatonin. These are things that can really help gird your system very specifically. They can help you protect against inflammation and the oxidative stress that this virus is going to cause. It will help your immune system build its own natural immunity, it's natural fighting force, the way it should.

So let's talk about food. For example, all of our favorites pretty much need to go at this point in time: the pizza, the burgers, the fries, the chili dogs, the Philly steak sandwiches, you know, all those wonderful things. Not good for you. It's inflammatory. Whether it's New York style pizza or Chicago style pizza, either way, it's all pizza and we should be minimizing those things.

Now, there are some practicalities of life. If we're under confinement, most of what we do is we order out and somebody delivers to us. So in a way we're kind of stuck. But the other side is that while we say we can order good foods, most of us won't most of the time; but we can take nutrients that can also be delivered to our doorsteps, that can help support our immune systems and decrease inflammation, even with a poor diet.

Rebekah Kelley: That's really interesting. Is there anything else we should know about these vaccines?

Albert Mensah: Well, they're going to get better. We don't know what all the side effect potentials are. Let's be real. That's what it is I do. There's a reason why we say we have to exercise caution. It's because this is a life or death matter for many people that we even just say, look, here's the vaccine. We know it works. Side effects? You might want to deal with the side effects and still be alive as opposed to just being dead without the vaccine. That's the bottom line. There is no physician I know of who, if given that choice, isn't going to err on the side of ultra caution. They are not going to play the Russian roulette game. That's not what we're doing.

The other thing, though, is that as we look at cross-reactivity and cross protection, some of the traditional vaccines that are coming out actually have better protection against some of the variants of COVID than the mRNA vaccines do. And vice versa, by the way. Whether we're talking about the UK version or the South African version, there's a different vaccine coverage. The traditional vaccines that are coming out, for example, will tend to cover the South African variant better than the mRNA vaccines do. And then there's dosing: two shots versus one shot. Two shots for the mRNA vaccines and one shot for the ones that are yet to come. That makes a difference, as well.

One thing people are very confused about is, if they get COVID and they have antibodies, do they need to get yet another vaccine? I'm going to be honest with you. I disagree with quite a bit that some of the folks out there are saying. They're trying to say let's cover our butts, in a way. Let's make sure by doing everything we can.

Here's the problem I have with that. If you've got COVID, if you have antibodies, and what a vaccine does is helps you make antibodies, then we don't know for sure that we're going to be super stacking antibodies by having a booster vaccine, on top of the antibodies we've got already. But here's the thing. There are always side effects to every vaccine that we have. And because we don't know the full range of them, I'm a little bit more cautious about saying you should mandatorily have a COVID vaccine after you've got antibodies, after you've had COVID, at least within the timeframe of 6 months. We' re pretty sure that your antibodies are going to last at least 3 to 4 months, minimum. So maybe at that point in time, reevaluate with your doctor, is the way I'll put it.

Rebekah Kelley: Thanks, Dr. Mensah. Those are valuable insights. Dr. Mensah can be found at MensaMedical.com.

David Stouder: Welcome to the Humanized podcast. It's all about personalizing your health. I'm your host, Dave Stouder. Now today we'll be discussing Schizophrenia with Dr. Albert Mensah. And before I introduce Dr. Mensah, I want to remind everyone to subscribe, to get all of our variety of casts – audio, video transcript – at HumanizedHealth.com. Very simple. I'd also like to thank our lead sponsor, Village Green Apothecary. You can find them at MyVillageGreen.com, as well. 
Now I'm going to tell you a little bit about our guest today, and do want you to know that at the end of the podcast, we'll let you know his website so you can get in touch with him, as well. 
Dr. Albert Mensah specializes in treating mental health disorders through biochemical lab testing and individualized targeted nutrient therapy. He's co-founder of Mensah Medical in Warrenville, Illinois, an integrative health clinic, as well as the Mensah Research Institute, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to conducting, supporting and presenting research that provides scientific evidence of the efficacy of targeted nutrient therapy.
Well, Dr. Mensah, we're going to talk about, I think, a condition, schizophrenia, that most people don't associate with nutrient therapy. So you suggested in the past that there is a physiological cause for schizophrenia, that it's not just, quote ""all in the patient's head."" What exactly do you mean by that?
Albert Mensah: You know, we've had this misconception. We've had a mis-analysis that goes back to what I would call psychiatric antiquity. We look at schizophrenia and conditions like bipolar as though they're mental health phenomena. And they're actually not mental health phenomena. So what do I mean by that?
So, in medicine, the way psychiatry came about was that we would define every single test we know how to perform for the human body, for chemistries, for blood, for urine analyses. And when we found nothing and someone was behaving erratically or differently, we would then say, ah, this is a psychiatric disorder.
Okay. But what happens when you now test and find imbalances that correlate with the strange or average behavior of the patient? By definition, it's no longer a psychiatric disorder. It's now a medical disorder, an actual medicine phenomenon, meaning we have symptoms, we have a history, we have testing that reveals the underlying mechanisms or disorder, and then we have correction or at least improvement. By definition, that's a medical problem, not a psychiatric problem. So when we were talking about physical or physiologic issues, we're talking about the very dysregulated factors that go into the production of the symptoms that lead to a diagnosis of schizophrenia.
So in other words, when you say ""it's in your head,"" well, guess what? It may be in your brain, but it may not be part of your actual mentation. When we talk about physiology or physical, it may actually be in your body. For example, approximately 6% of individuals who come down with a diagnosis of schizophrenia actually have as a cause an inflammatory bowel disorder. Guess what? Treat the inflammatory bowel disorder in these people and the schizophrenic signs and symptoms go away. By definition, did they ever have schizophrenia? No. They had an inflamed bowel, oftentimes due to dietary infractions and dietary inflammation in the system. And that's why they began to behave the way they did.
So we've become a lot more savvy about what is really causing what, in the world of mental health. And we're finding that a lot of mental health is not mental at all. It's actually physical or physiologic. 
David Stouder: Well, that's interesting because, I mean, I would get the impression that most practitioners, if I came in acting, you know, like I had schizophrenia, erratically, and they said, oh, his gut is messed up or inflamed, they would say, well, that's something different, let's move on. So what you're saying is we need to look... There are a lot more things in the body, to use maybe a cliche term, holistic. But if we look at these patterns, it may not be just something is all wrong in your mind. There's actually a physiological...
Now, are you on the cutting edge of this? Are many practitioners using this approach or is this something you're developing? 
Albert Mensah: No, absolutely, we are. It's not even in development. Here's the funny thing. This was developed a long time ago by the fabulous Dr. Carl Pfeiffer. I call him sort of the grandfather of our process here, generationally speaking. He was the one, MD, PhD, who got tired of what we see in traditional psychiatry, seeing patients, you know, snowed with medication and said, there's got to be a cause for this. And he evaluated these things and found these imbalances. And guess what? People woke up from catatonia. People normalized their lives from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and no longer had a diagnosis, all by correcting the biochemical imbalances that were in the body and in the brain. 
So this is not new. This is not Mensah doing this. I'm honored to have been part of the process of the education, and therefore we teach globally, we speak globally about this because we have to educate people and let them know, wait a minute – this is not some mystical phenomenon that has to do with the time your dog died 50 years ago. Or the problem you have with your mother or whomever, or whatever relationship. 
This is about biochemical aberrations. It's oftentimes a combination of what is an environmental insult, superimposed upon genetic predisposition. So we do have a combination of environmental factors, but superimposed upon an internal dysregulation or weakness. That's what we call epigenetics. Now THERE is the field for today: epigenetics, how the outside world affects us. 
David Stouder: Right. In other words, how we have genes, but they... there's input from the environment, our inner and outer environment, that causes them to express. 
Well, this brings me to another question. I mean, my impression, and I don't know if this impression is just from, you know, with social media connecting you to everything everywhere, but it seems like cases of schizophrenia and some of these similar kinds of disorders are on the rise. One is, do you agree? And if so, do you have an idea of why that would be? 
Albert Mensah: Absolutely. First of all, I do agree. And let's look at the world we're in right now. If we talk about the development of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, either one, as being related to some type of stress-induced insult or phenomena, let's look at the world we're living in currently. We have a global pandemic. We have people sequestered from their families. We have relationships in challenge. We've got internal stressors, external stressors, we've got emotional dysregulation, we've got business variables. People have lost their jobs, are losing their homes. What part of stress isn't happening in the world today?
Are we surprised then that individuals who may have a genetic predisposition, when we now superimpose an outside stressor, that we're showing up and seeing more schizophrenia? And let me say something also that's oftentimes controversial, but it really isn't. It's more about financial compensation. But now the legalization in many states of illicit substances like marijuana – this is not a question, it is fact. One in six males who even uses marijuana periodically will develop psychosis or schizophrenia. I treat these individuals. I see it all the time. We said this before it was legalized. We certainly talked about it when it was in the process of legalization in the state of Illinois, and we spoke against it. 
So let's take all these variables now. We've got illicit drugs. We've got outside stressors and influences. We've got a world in global chaos. Yes, we're going to see more of these so-called diagnoses labeled schizophrenia. 
Now I want to be very clear. Schizophrenia is not one disease or disorder. It is actually a family, a group, a constellation of syndromes that have similar patterns and therefore they're labeled as one disorder. They're not. Okay. It is not. Schizophrenia is a group of different chemistries, different situations that lead to dysregulated mental processing and therefore behavior. 
David Stouder: So, you know, I'll look at it this way. Obviously, medications can provide some relief, they play a role in all of this, but I think we're moving... I think what you're going to say here is that yes, some of these traditional drugs have their uses, but we need to go beyond that because just covering up, tapping down some of the expressions of the problem are not getting to the root cause. 
Albert Mensah: Absolutely correct. Absolutely. And please don't misunderstand me. I'm not actually even saying in this instance that these medications are bad. No one is speaking against the medication. Many times individuals need to have some level of immediate temperance or quick temperance of symptoms in order to try to gain some level of stability, whether it's emotional or physical, or even just functional stability. But they're not getting to the root cause of the issue, and that's where you need to have a good biochemical assessment in order to determine where the dysregulations are and then look to correct them. So yes, medications can be useful, but they're not the key treatment. They are a temporizing measure. Absolutely. 
David Stouder: Well, you had mentioned in the beginning that people expressing schizophrenic symptoms, and then it turned out in this case you mentioned, to be like gut inflammation, and when the gut inflammation was corrected, the symptoms went away. Unlike medications, then you become dependent on them. The symptoms can go away when you're taking them but, you know, they all have some downsides, so if we could minimize or not use them in certain cases, I think that would be, obviously, to everyone's benefit.
Albert Mensah: Without question. Absolutely. I will state though that, and this is odd for me to say, but in defense of the pharmaceutical industry here for a moment, many of these medications in the short term are not quite as problematic, outside of their side effect profile. It's when folks are on these things for years and years and years, and we start to see more challenge with regard to the difficulty of either weaning off, or how our patient is actually able to recover from their original condition because of the medications. But sometimes they're just very necessary short-term pieces. 
David Stouder: I think you make a lot of sense there. And before we end up, I do have a question, before we give out your website. So you're in Illinois. People hearing this interview that are interested in what you're saying, and maybe not getting this kind of approach around here or where they are. Are you able to work with people remotely? 
Albert Mensah: Oh, absolutely. COVID has forced a lot of change in the field of medicine. So now with telemedicine and telehealth, our patients are more easily accessible, literally globally. So we have patients from all over the country and literally different countries on the planet. So it's a great opportunity to learn about different cultures, to meet different people, and to be able to provide some level of service. 
David Stouder: Dr Mensah, thank you. I think that's going to mean a lot to a lot of people. Now, we want you to know that Dr. Mensah can be found at www – and I will spell it – MensahMedical.com, and that's M-E-N-S-A-H-Medical.com.

I'm so glad to have Dr. Mensah here. Let me tell you a little bit about him. Dr. Mensah specializes in treating mental health disorders through biochemical, lab testing and individualized targeted nutrient therapy. He's co-founder of Mensah Medical in Warrenville, Illinois, an integrative health clinic, as well as the Mensah Research Institute, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to conducting, supporting, and presenting research that provides scientific evidence of the efficacy of targeted nutrient therapy. Man, that is a mission and goal that is sorely needed. 
Again, welcome to Humanized Health, Dr. Mensah. 
Albert Mensah: Thank you, Dave. 
David Stouder: Yeah. You've suggested that there's a connection between autism and Alzheimer's. And you know, it's interesting, I think in people's minds, autism is associated with young people now and Alzheimer's with older people. But what is that connection? I mean, they seem awfully different and like I said, they affect different populations. So, what's the connection that you see? 
Albert Mensah: Well, first Dave, at the risk of sounding pedantic, I'm not suggesting anything. This is a fact. And the reason I say that is because our treatment protocol for Alzheimer's actually originated with our treatment protocol for autism. So when you have that piece and you're using a similar treatment protocol and you're getting results, what other conclusion can you draw? And the key here is about neurodegeneration.
What many people don't understand is that the commonality between the two is that these are two neurodegenerative disorders. Now, Dave, don't we usually think about neurodegeneration in terms of older individuals? Right? Who would've thought that a 3-year-old a, 2-year-old, a 4-year-old would have a neurodegenerative disorder? But guess what? It is.
Autism is neurodegenerative by nature. The way people don't view it, is that if you don't realize, if you actually don't treat an autistic child, they become less and less intelligent over time, in general. They lose intellectual points. They lose as they get older, the capacity to really shift as efficiently as they could. They become harder and harder and harder to fix or correct. And what do we see in Alzheimer's? Individuals gradually decline. I'm making this sound very simplistic because in some respects it is, and in some respects it's a lot more complicated. But the fact is, both are neurodegenerative disorders and both respond to very specific treatments that are very similar.
David Stouder: Interesting. Now, one of the things that you talk about, oxidative stress, we might call it brain rust – I mean, what does that look like? Do we actually see spots on the brain? Is that different than just kind of being stressed out? Because as we discussed before, there's no shortage of stressors in the world today. So can we see physical, quote, ""rust"" in the brain? 
Albert Mensah: Well, in these particular cases, no. What we see are really the manifestations of that, we'll call it ""biochemical rust,"" if you will, in terms of inflammation. So oxidative stress and inflammation are a vicious cycle. Each one leads to the other and as the cycle moves, the whole thing gets larger and larger and larger. It's like an expanding spiral. So the more inflammation you have, the more oxidative stress you have. 
Now, what is oxidative stress? It is basically cellular rust. So if you think about that old pickup truck on the farm that we see in movies all the time, and it's got the holes in the fenders, and the engine doesn't work and all that kind of stuff, this is what we would oftentimes call rust or oxidation.
Now imagine that with regard to a cell structure where the cell membranes are holey and they don't work. They leak. There's inflammation. The cell just can't function properly. It looks more like a shriveled up old raisin as opposed to a nice firm grape. That's what oxidative stress is and the inflammation that goes along with it, and these are extremely key features in both autism and Alzheimer's disease.
David Stouder: Interesting. So we have, like you say, two key features, both if left untreated get worse with time and age, and then both, we can see evidence of oxidative stress. Now that's a complicated issue, but in general, maybe you can give us the key points, then. From that perspective, how do we treat autism and Alzheimer's? How do we manage or eliminate that oxidative stress?
Albert Mensah: There are many ways to look at this and we don't have enough time unfortunately, to go through the specifics – but certainly not worsening the conditions. We need to keep things as anti-inflammatory as possible. So dietary changes, environmental changes, using the right nutrient support systems, lovely antioxidants – those are all nice adjunctive pieces to stop things from getting worse. But you have to still delve in there and get into the oxidative stress aspect and to stop that from progressing, and even to reverse it. And that's possible, but those therapies are usually a lot more complicated and a lot of them are, unfortunately, private information. 
And they’re complexes, they're not one singular piece. So it's not like, okay, take an aspirin or take this. These are programs that are put together to treat the biochemistry and the oxidative stress simultaneously. And they are oftentimes very individualized. One of the big mistakes with autism is that people think you can go out and get a multivitamin, you can go out and get one product that's going to treat all cases of autism. It doesn't work that way. Every autistic individual is an autistic individual. And when your world revolves around bio-individuality, you've got to approach each person in the same way [with a bio-individuality approach]. 
Now, what is very different though, is that with Alzheimer's, here's where the two are a little bit different – with Alzheimer's, you can pretty much attack these central areas fairly similarly in almost everybody. So it's not the hugely individualistic piece that you see with autism. Both have neurodegeneration as a feature, but classically speaking, the Alzheimer's regimen will work very well in almost everybody, assuming that they're still in the mild to moderate stages. Where we have trouble is when they're in the moderate to severe stages. 
But these are some of the similarities and the differences between the two disorders. 
David Stouder: Well you know, what you just said almost answered the question that came to my mind. What I notice about people is that they don't turn to mother nature first and in a lot of cases, just in a broad way, I think some aspects of the medical community make people think that diet, lifestyle nutrition is somehow magic instead of central to good health. So they have a condition, they ride it to where nothing has helped and they're getting worse and worse, and then they go, gee, I wonder if anything from the natural world could help me. And what you just said was, right away, when we see these things, we deal with them from this point of view as well – whatever medications are necessary, we deal with that because the longer we wait, the less chance we have of making an impact. Is that fair?
Albert Mensah: Absolutely. I mean, you don't take a car to the shop and, if you're driving one brand, say that, well, gee, you know, what we need to do is instead of fixing the engine, let's put some duct tape around it and hope that it works. You've got to replace the parts. We are human machines, and you've got to use the parts that are original, or similarly original parts, to fix the parts that are broken. I mean, this kind of logic really is not that complicated, but you're absolutely right, in medicine, we've gone beyond to make ourselves appear to be something that we're not. We are fabulously made machines. And you've got to use the right parts, the original parts, the similar parts, in order to fix the problem. We would all be incensed if we were to take our Mercedes and our BMWs and try to use, I hate to put it this way, Tesla parts or something that simply would not work with that system. System for system, you have to go in and replace or augment what is there with reasonable biologic parts.
David Stouder: You know, Dr. Mensah, you said that you teach all over the world and I'm glad because that message in general, as well as specifically for things like Alzheimer's and autism, are really necessary, and I'm impressed. 
I want everybody to know that Dr. Mensah can be found at MensahMedical.com, and you can see it on the website, but it's M-E-N-S-A-H-Medical.com.

Rebekah Kelley: Welcome to the Humanized Podcast, your health personalized, made possible by Village Green Apothecary. I'm your host, Rebekah Kelley.

Our guest today is Dr. Michael Murray. Dr. Murray is one of the world's leading authorities on natural medicine. He has published over 30 books featuring natural approaches to health. He is a graduate, former faculty member, and serves on the Board of Regents of Bastyr University in Seattle, Washington.

Dr. Murray has dedicated his life to educating physicians, patients and the general public on the tremendous healing power of nature. In addition to his books, which have cumulative sales of over 5 million copies, Dr. Murray has written numerous articles for major publications, appeared in hundreds of radio and TV programs, and lectured to hundreds of thousands of people nationwide. For the past 35 years, Dr. Murray has been compiling a massive database of original scientific studies from medical literature. He has personally collected over 65,000 articles from scientific literature, which provide strong evidence on the effectiveness of diet, vitamins, minerals, herbs and other natural measures in the maintenance of health and the treatment of disease. It is from this constantly expanding database that Dr. Murray provides answers on health and healing. Thanks for being on the show, Dr. Murray.

Dr. Michael Murray: My pleasure.

Rebekah Kelley: You have shared that you had COVID. You've had the experience and taken steps to address it. What foods did you take or eat? What supplements? How did you combat it? So if someone else finds themselves in that situation, what could they do?

Dr. Michael Murray: Well, on a daily basis, I take 27 different supplements. So I generally take quite a bit. I did have COVID, but it wasn't very severe. I just felt like I had jet lag. But I'm thankful for the experience, because it was a different type of fatigue. Now I can empathize with people who are still suffering from the long haul version of COVID, where they're battling this fatigue.

When I started having symptoms and I thought this might be COVID, I went and got tested. However, I was feeling better almost immediately. I just did the smart thing and rested and took more supplements than my normal hardy mix. But I started dosing with quercetin. Quercetin has some really interesting effects against this virus and it's being studied right now in eight double-blind, placebo controlled studies.

One of the great outcomes of this pandemic has been how fast many researchers have been able to get grants to study some of these natural compounds. If you look at the number of studies that are being done with nutritional supplements and natural products, it's probably in the range of 500 total. But there are eight studies right now utilizing quercetin.

Quercetin is a flavonoid. It's responsible for the colors we see in many fruits, flowers and vegetables. Quercetin is kind of the backbone flavonoid. It's really important for fighting this virus and has been shown to exert a number of blocking effects on it. Everyone probably is aware that this virus has spike proteins that bind to certain receptors called ACE2 receptors. Well,  quercetin can inhibit that binding. Quercetin also increases the concentration of ionic zinc in the cells. And zinc blocks the replication of the virus. Quercetin can also directly neutralize viral proteins that are critical for that virus to replicate. So there are a lot of interesting actions with quercetin.

Regular quercetin is not absorbed very well. So people need to utilize more absorbable forms. One is called EMIQ. Another is Quercetin Phytosome. And the one that I took was called Quercetin LipoMicel Matrix; it's made by Natural Factors. I really liked that product. I'd recommend taking, for prevention, just 2 capsules a day. But as soon as someone starts showing symptoms or tests positive, they're going to need much higher doses. I would take four capsules twice a day. They're going to need eight capsules a day or 2,000 milligrams of the Quercetin Phytosome or the Quercetin LipoMicel Matrix.

Rebekah Kelley: Anything in addition to the quercetin?

Dr. Michael Murray: Well, you know, you really need to bump up vitamin C. There's some really good studies that have been done with high dose intravenous vitamin C in people who were hospitalized. It basically cuts the death rate in half. So just giving people high doses of vitamin C intravenously in hospitals might have saved half the people that died. If you're not hospitalized with the virus, you still need vitamin C to help reduce the severity. So I would bump up vitamin C levels when you're dealing with an active infection. I think 500 to 1,000 milligrams every 2 hours, or at least three times a day, is a good thing to do.

Vitamin D3, I think, has more effects preventatively. But I would still do vitamin D3. The fat-soluble vitamin that is really useful when you're having an active infection is vitamin A. The concern about vitamin A is if there's any chance a woman could be pregnant or get pregnant, then she can only take 5,000 IUs. For men and women, where there's no chance of getting pregnant, most nutritionally oriented doctors would recommend taking 50,000 IUs of vitamin A for a 1 to 3-day period.

This high dose of vitamin A has been shown to be very helpful in many parts of the world in dealing with viral infections. I think it's a powerful way to change things quickly with this virus. It hasn't been studied in COVID-19, but it's been studied in other viral illnesses. So there's a history of vitamin A that shows that it's safe if administered at high doses, for short periods of time with viral illnesses. But I wouldn't do it any more than 3 days. 50,000 IUs of vitamin A per day for 3 days, I think can really help turn the tide.

Rebekah Kelley: Okay. So anything beyond that?

Dr. Michael Murray: I still like N-acetyl cysteine. I talked about that in my earlier interview. A little different now. We still want to boost glutathione not only for its antiviral activities, but now, for its anti-inflammatory effects. N- acetyl cysteine is a mucolytic. It's been used in hospitals for decades to help break down thick mucus. So this is really important in any upper respiratory tract infection. We want to make sure that the respiratory tract is as protected as possible, that it is not being clogged by thick, heavy mucus. N- acetyl cysteine can break up that thick mucus, help clear an infection faster, and also prevent a secondary bacterial infection.

Rebekah Kelley: I've heard you mention that it's not just a respiratory situation with COVID-19, but it's also internal, gastrointestinal. Are there any foods that you would recommend people focus on or make sure that they're part of their diet?

Dr. Michael Murray: Yeah, I do believe that this virus is as much gastrointestinal infection as it is respiratory tract infection. There's a lot of data to support that. All these supplements that we've been talking about are very important for barrier function.

The key thing with gastrointestinal function is to keep things flowing, making sure that people are eating enough fiber and drinking enough water and keeping things fluid.

I like a lot of phytochemicals to help with this situation with COVID-19. Drinking ginger tea, or taking a ginger shot, or herbal teas in general, getting enough richly colored fruits and vegetables, and juicing are all great ways to deliver those phytochemicals when people are sick and not wanting to eat or not well enough to eat. So those are some things that I would strongly recommend, especially during an active infection, but also as a preventative, as well.

Rebekah Kelley: So as we wrap this up, if you were choosing three to five points saying this is what you need to do, what would you would focus on?

Dr. Michael Murray: For an active infection, focus on things we know can help turn the tide quickly. I think quercetin will be shown to do that. N-acetyl cysteine is a must. High doses of vitamin A. Continue to have supportive nutrients for our immune system. Stay well hydrated; drink lots of teas, herbal teas, ginger shots, fresh vegetable juices and broths. Get enough rest and take it easy. Those are all general recommendations for letting your body heal and recover.

Rebekah Kelley: Well, thank you so much, Dr. Murray. We really appreciate your being on the show. Have a great day.

Dr. Michael Murray: All right. Thank you."

Rebekah Kelley: Welcome to the Humanized Podcast, Your Health Personalized.

I'm your host, Rebekah Kelley. Our guest today is Dr. Michael Murray. Dr. Murray is one of the world's leading authorities on natural medicine. He has published over 30 books featuring natural approaches to health. He is a graduate, former faculty member, and serves on the Board of Regents of Bastyr University in Seattle, Washington. Dr. Murray has dedicated his life to educating physicians, patients, and the general public on the tremendous healing power of nature.

In addition to his books, which have cumulative sales of over 5 million copies, Dr. Murray has written numerous articles for major publications, appeared in hundreds of radio and TV programs, and lectured to hundreds of thousands of people nationwide.

For the past 35 years, Dr. Murray has been compiling a massive database of original scientific studies from medical literature. He has personally collected over 65,000 articles from scientific literature, which provide strong evidence on the effectiveness of diet, vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other natural measures in the maintenance of health and the treatment of disease. It is from this constantly expanding database that Dr. Murray provides answers on health and healing. Thanks for being on the show, Dr. Murray.

Dr. Michael Murray: My pleasure.

Rebekah Kelley: Our first question is related to risk factors for COVID-19. It's such a timely thing. For nutritional deficiencies, what should we be aware of? Also, what would you want to share regarding certain drugs that could adversely affect COVID-19, or other relevant information?

Dr. Michael Murray: It's been well publicized that there are a number of comorbidities: obesity, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, chronic renal disease, and taking immunosuppressive drugs. When they've looked at vitamin D levels, they've discovered that if you have good levels, you're not going to have a severe outcome. But if you are low in vitamin D3, it increases your risk for having more severe disease, having to go to the ICU, and, potentially, dying from it.

Just looking at the data and statistics that we have right now, when they sift through all this data, they're going to come to the conclusion that we could have done a lot more for these people. One of the things that the government or somebody should have done, right off the bat, was institute a mass vitamin D3 supplementation program.

I say that because, if you look at vitamin D3 levels, ideally nutritionally- oriented doctors like to see blood levels above 60 nanograms per mL. Studies show that when people had levels below 20 and got COVID, it was almost a death sentence. Mortality rate was about 98%. Just a little bit higher, 24, again, not ideal, but just that little bit more wasn't associated with that same degree of mortality.

I think we could have changed the outcome considerably if we had just had people supplementing with vitamin D3. So, roughly, about 400,000 people died.

If we would have helped those people just get their vitamin D3 levels up to 30 – 60 is ideal – but if we just got them up to 30, the death rate may have been as low as 40,000. We would have reduced it by a factor of tenfold.

Rebekah Kelley: That's powerful. And so many of us are low. We know that when we go get it tested. In addition to the need for vitamin D, what else would you want us to know about?

Dr. Michael Murray: Even something simple like vitamin C levels are very low in COVID-19. Also, zinc is very important.

I'm a big fan of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). This is a form of an amino acid that has been shown to boost glutathione levels. All of those comorbidities that I mentioned, high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, chronic renal disease, chronic lung disease, they're all associated with having low glutathione status. This is another major risk factor for having a severe outcome with this disorder. We know that glutathione levels can be boosted with N-acetyl cysteine. N-acetyl cysteine has some immune-enhancing activity.

In fact, if you compare N-acetyl cysteine to a flu vaccine for preventing upper respiratory tract infections, the N-acetyl cysteine outperforms a flu shot. The National Institutes of Health has kept track on the benefits of flu shots since 2003. They estimate that it's about 10 to 60% effective depending upon the year. But that's significantly less effective than a study with N-acetyl cysteine.

Vitamin D3 is another substance that has been shown to be very helpful in protecting against upper respiratory tract infection, particularly the flu. So there's a lot we can do. Simple things, like taking a high-potency multiple vitamin, taking extra vitamin C, and making sure we get our vitamin D3 levels up.

Rebekah Kelley: You have described how important many different factors are; you have referenced it like a car. It's not just gas, but you also need oil and other fluids, you need to make sure your brakes work – it's many things working together.

Dr. Michael Murray: One of the things about nutritional compounds is that they have some benefits on their own, but the thing that we have to realize is they don't work independently that much. They work as a part of a system. We really need all of these nutrients working together.

The critical statement that I'll make right now is, a deficiency of any single nutrient can lead to significant depression of the immune system. It could mean the difference between being able to fight off this virus effectively or dying from it.

Nutritional adequacy is absolutely critical. These compounds are essential nutrients. That means they are absolutely essential in order for our immune system to function properly. It's kind of silly that hasn't been looked at enough. If you look at the groups of people who are really hit hard by this virus, nutritional deficiencies are common. People are looking at racial factors, economic factors, and co-morbidities. But the common factor in all these situations is nutritional status.

Rebekah Kelley: Wow, that's powerful. If there was a way that you would summarize what you just shared in three to five points, although we talked about how important it is to have the whole car running with all of its fluids, if there were three to five, what would that summary be?

Dr. Michael Murray: You mean three to five causative factors?

Rebekah Kelley: Take-aways. If someone was going to do three to five things. If they only heard this and they knew they needed to take steps. What would those steps be?

Dr. Michael Murray: The first step I would recommend, because the data is so strong, is get your vitamin D3 levels up. Ideally, get a blood test to see where you are. You want to get your vitamin D3 level above 60 nanograms per mL. If it's below 20 and you get COVID, it carries with it a 100% mortality rate. Just getting it up to 34, again, that's not ideal, but just getting it up to 34 was associated with a 0% mortality rate. So when I tell people we could have cut the overall mortality rate tenfold if we would have just gotten vitamin D3 levels up, there's data to support that.

If the big take-away is get your vitamin D3 levels up, the next is that your immune system requires a steady stream of nutrients. Take a good, high- potency multiple vitamin and mineral formula. We're focused on some of those important, immune-supportive ingredients, such as vitamin C. Maybe take some extra vitamin C, 500 to 1,000 milligrams per day. Make sure you’re getting zinc, 20 milligrams for a woman per day, 30 milligrams per day for a man. Those are absolutely critical to fight this virus.

Rebekah Kelley: Okay. So vitamin D, make sure we are getting a good multiple, so we have good balanced nutrition, and then zinc.

Dr. Michael Murray: Yes. A little extra vitamin C, 500 to 1,000 milligrams should be enough.

I also mentioned N-acetyl cysteine. I think it's important, particularly if you have any of those co-morbidities, because they're all associated with low glutathione status. So if you have high blood pressure, chronic lung disease, chronic renal disease, you have obesity or type 2 diabetes, take 600 to 1,200 milligrams of N-acetyl cysteine per day, and that'll go a long way to help protect your lungs from this infection.

Rebekah Kelley: Thank you so much, Dr. Murray. We really appreciate your being on the show. I really appreciate having you.

Dr. Michael Murray: All right. Thank you.

I'd also like to thank our lead sponsor, Village Green Apothecary, at MyVillageGreen.com. 
A little bit about Dr. Murray. He is one of the world's leading authorities on natural medicine. He's dedicated his life to educating physicians, patients and the general public on the tremendous healing power of nature. Dr. Murray has published over 300 books, written numerous articles for major publications, and has appeared on hundreds of radio and TV programs. Dr. Murray is a graduate, former faculty member, and serves on the Board of Regents at Bastyr University in Seattle, Washington. 
We're so happy to have you here.
Michael Murray: It's my pleasure. 
Rebekah Kelley: So we're talking about, What Are Adaptogens? What are some common examples? 
Michael Murray: Well, common examples include the ginsengs, Siberian and Chinese ginseng, Rhodiola, ashwagandha and maca. 
Rebekah Kelley: And, what health benefits do adaptogens produce? 
Michael Murray: Well let's first of all define what is an adaptogen. Adaptogens have been used historically across the globe, different adaptogens based upon what was growing there. But the idea is that these are a plant that will be able to improve our ability to withstand stress and enhance our mental, physical and sexual performance. So these are great energy boosters, are great for enhancing all sorts of different biological processes. 
So, I've given you some examples. What we know now about adaptogens is that they work very interestingly on stress mechanisms and in particular, in supporting our adrenal glands. And our adrenal glands are these two glands that sit on top of each kidney and they're responsible for secreting a lot of the hormones. Most people are familiar with adrenaline. That's one of its key hormones, and it plays a big role in the fight-or-flight response. The stress response in all of these plants that I just mentioned, the ginsengs, Rhodiola, ashwagandha, maca, they all seem to impart some health benefits to the adrenal glands.
Rebekah Kelley: Awesome. So which adaptogen should we choose to use, or should I use, or should we use, in general? 
Michael Murray: Yeah, it really depends on a few different things. There's a lot of overlap, but if we try to dial in specific adaptogens based upon a person's age or sex, or the degree of stress they're dealing with, we can do that.
I'm really quite impressed with the research on ashwagandha and in particular, there are two high quality extracts. One is called Sensoril and the other is called KSM-66. And, either one of these is showing really good effects on helping us deal with stress, and exert some additional benefits. I like ashwagandha for its effects on brain health, in particular. It may have a role in kind of preventing some of the age-related decline in mental function and the low mood that we often see as people get older. So I really like ashwagandha for people that are dealing with a lot of stress, anxiety, maybe some sleep issues, and they're getting up there in age. I really, really like ashwagandha for the older population. And by older, I mean my age, anything 60 plus. 
Rebekah Kelley: So what are some other adaptogens and how would they affect our health and wellness? 
Michael Murray: The ginsengs are probably the most well-known adaptogens, and there's a lot of good science on either Chinese or Siberian ginseng. Chinese, or Panax ginseng, I think is a bit stronger and it has energy enhancing abilities. So I like to use it when people are really debilitated, maybe they're coming out of a long illness or they've really been dealing with stress over a long period of time, and it's just pretty much exhausted their adrenals, really kind of decimated their physiology. I think that's a great indication for Panax ginseng. It's very uplifting and has some good energy promoting activity. I think it's really good for athletes, men in particular, with a lot of yang energy. You know, a lot of times they can take subtler plant adaptogens and really not feel any punch. We give those guys, and some women that need that extra punch, we give them the Panax ginseng and they really can feel the energy enhancement and the improved performance. Siberian ginseng is a little gentler than Panax ginseng, so I generally like it more for women than Panax ginseng. And it too has some really good stress-relieving and energy-enhancing effects.
There's a couple other adaptogens that I'll get to as well, to give you some subtle differentiations. Rhodiola, or arctic root, has a lot of good data as kind of a mood elevating adaptogen. So it has the ability to help with anxiety, but it's really a mood elevator, so it would be my choice in someone who is really feeling blue and really needed a boost in their mood, as well as their energy and dealing with stress.
So those are some of the big ones. And I really want to spend a lot of time talking about maca because I think maca is an adaptogen that we all can benefit from on a regular basis. Maca is kind of newer to the stage compared to these other plant medicines, but it's been a big part of medicine in Peru – that's where maca is grown. It's a member of the cabbage family or broccoli family, and it looks a lot like a turnip and comes in a lot of different colors – black, red and yellow – and I like to think of maca as kind of a concentrated source of all those chemicals that we know are a benefit that are found in kale and cabbage and broccoli and Brussels sprouts. Maca has all those benefits, and more. It helps the entire endocrine system, our hormonal system. It has been shown to basically improve body processes and it does so primarily through its effects on the pituitary, the adrenals, the thyroids, the ovaries, the testes, the pineal gland. So some of the benefits that we see, we see improved detoxification – you see that with all the cabbage family vegetables – we see higher energy levels. 
The historical aspects of maca are quite interesting. It has a lot of folklore attached to it. It was used in the native culture for thousands of years and it has a storied history. So it has some incredible effects on boosting fertility and sexual function, has some effects on improving sleep and mood as well. I really like maca for just about everybody. And I think it provides many of the benefits that we see from traditional adaptogens – ashwagandha, the ginsengs and Rhodiola – but you add to that all of these benefits that we know that these cabbage family vegetables have, and that includes not only detoxification and anti-cancer effects, but some really interesting effects on reproductive function. And maca has been shown to have some very interesting effects on women. Research on menopausal women using maca shows that maca can actually increase the woman's own production of estrogen. And so it can basically prolong their reproductive life and delay some of the symptoms and aspects of menopause. After menopause, we still see some benefit with maca. It can stimulate estrogen, not to the same level that you would see in a woman of reproductive age, but we see an increase in estrogen to a level that can reduce some of the symptoms like hot flashes, insomnia, depression, irritability, nervousness and diminished concentration. It also lowers cortisol level, and that's the stress hormone. 
That's one of the things that we see with all of these adaptogens, Rebekah, and I think that that's not only important and in fighting stress. Cortisol is one of the few hormones that actually increases as we get older, and it has a ravaging effect on our brain, our muscle mass, our bone mass. So if we can keep cortisol levels lower as we get older, we can really impact preventing those very serious consequences of aging – osteoporosis, dementia, memory loss, loss of muscle mass, low immune function, depression, insomnia. These are all linked to excess cortisol. So if we can keep those cortisol levels by using the adaptogens and all the adaptogens that have that effect that I really like... I really like maca for most people.
Rebekah Kelley: It sounds like a super antigen, the maca.
Michael Murray: It's a true superfood. And it comes in a variety of different forms. You can get raw maca powder, and the dosage there is three to six grams per day. So it's not a huge dose compared to a lot of super foods, but it is bitter. You can add it to smoothies, to mask it a bit, but most of the time I'm recommending using some sort of organic, super strength maca extract. The product I have most familiarity with is the product from Natural Factors, it's called Organic MacaRich, and it contains a maca with a little bit of ginseng in there. It's produced in a kind of a traditional way. Maca is a root vegetable, has a lot of starch, so what is done first is they gelatinize the root, which means they remove all of the starch. This alone concentrates the active compounds. And when you use a concentrated, gelatinized maca, the dose is 1000 to 2000 milligrams per day. So it's easy to take it in a capsule or tablet. 
Rebekah Kelley: Wow. I'm definitely going to be adding that to my diet, for sure. Thanks, Dr. Murray, those are really valuable insights. Dr. Murray can be found www.DrMurray.com.

Dr. Murray, thank you so much for being here with us.
Michael Murray: It's my pleasure, Rebekah. 
Rebekah Kelley: So on the topic of, what is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, first off, what causes this? 
Michael Murray: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is liver disease caused by things that aren't related to alcohol. And non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is the most common liver disease in America. And what causes it, well, it's caused by obesity, is the primary cause. And we see fatty liver disease in virtually everyone who is obese. So the true number is actually probably closer to 40% and climbing. This is a major epidemic and it's not given enough attention because medicine doesn't have much to offer, but in natural medicine we have a lot to offer. And that's what we want to get to today.
Rebekah Kelley: So, what are some of the consequences of non-alcohol fatty liver disease? 
Michael Murray: It plays a big role in the metabolic syndrome, and metabolic syndrome we know is related to insulin resistance. So we get an increased risk for type 2 diabetes, we get increased risk for cardiovascular disease and virtually all metabolic disease. So our liver, this is so important to our overall health. The liver performs over 500 separate jobs and it's critical to every aspect of our physiology. It's involved in our immune function, our detoxification, our hormonal system, our digestion. So when we have impaired liver function, we have impaired health and we have an impaired life.
Rebekah Kelley: That's a huge hit. 
Michael Murray: Yeah. 
Rebekah Kelley: What are some natural approaches to non-alcohol fatty liver? 
Michael Murray: The first thing is trying to lose weight. Weight loss is curative for most people. It's that simple. And one of the things that I've found to be quite helpful in helping people achieve their weight goals is using a soluble fiber matrix called PGX. And I think that's really kind of the first step, is utilizing PGX. You take five grams before meals. It can promote satiety, reduce the amount of calories consumed, and it has an ability to improve the action of insulin. Getting insulin working better helps the liver and helps lose weight and control the appetite, as well. 
There's a lot of dietary factors that we can utilize as well to help with the liver. Sulfur-containing foods like garlic, legumes, onions, and even eggs. Good sources of soluble fiber, not just oat bran, but also pears, apples, legumes. Cabbage family vegetables, especially broccoli, Brussel sprouts and cabbage, and then things like artichokes, beets, carrots and dandelion can be very helpful.
There's a lot of nutritional supplements that we should be using in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. These include what are called lipotopics. These are compounds that promote the flow of bile and fat from the liver. This includes things like SAMe, betaine, choline, n-acetylcysteine (critical), B6, folic acid and vitamin B12. These are some of the key things that we need to use. 
And as far as plant medicines go, there are a long list of plants that can be helpful. Basically, we're utilizing many of the same plants that we use to help improve insulin sensitivity, help insulin work better, and that helps blood sugar control, and that takes a great stress off the liver. And that can allow that liver to kind of recuperate and flourish. As far as a specific herb, I like milk thistle. Milk thistle extract, silymarin, is well known for its ability to improve liver function. There's a special form called silybin phytosome. This is an enhanced form of milk thistle and it has shown particular benefit in non-alcohol fatty liver disease. The best studies used a dose of about 150 to 200 milligrams, three times a day. That's of the regular silymarin. With the silybin phytosome, we can use basically half that dose, 75 to 150 milligrams twice daily has been shown to be very effective.
So those are my recommendations as far as some supplements. To kind of kickstart people, I do like a 3-day juice fast. It just kind of gives that liver a vacation. And we should be taking some liver-supportive agents while we're going through that 3-day juice fast – vitamin C, take the fiber matrix that I mentioned, PGX, take a lipotropic formula with something like n-acetylcysteine or SAMe in it, and that can help keep things flowing. 
Rebekah Kelley: Is there anything else that you would suggest that one take as an approach? 
Michael Murray: Well again, anything that's going to be supportive for the liver is going to be helpful. I think n-acetylcysteine is something that can benefit people beyond supporting the liver. N-acetylcysteine is an active form of cystine, which is an amino acid and the body utilizes that to make a compound called glutathione. And glutathione is our main detoxifying compound. When the liver becomes deficient in glutathione, it leads to significant damage and fatty infiltration. People may know that can happen with Tylenol, with acetaminophen, especially if alcohol is consumed. Well, n-acetylcysteine is a medical treatment for liver damage caused by acetaminophen. If you go to the emergency room and you have Tylenol toxicity, they're going to give you n-acetylcysteine because it can rescue your liver. And it can rescue our liver in patients with non-alcohol fatty liver disease, as well. Typically, the dose is 600 milligrams twice a day. I think that is something that is really helpful for boosting those glutathione levels and protecting the liver and resolving this fatty infiltration. 
Rebekah Kelley: Is there anything else that we should know?
Michael Murray: Well, I think we call it non-alcohol fatty liver disease because it occurs in people that don't drink alcohol. But if you have this non-alcohol fatty liver disease and you drink alcohol, you're adding fuel to the fire. So, think about it. People are overweight, people are obese, they have fatty livers and they drink alcohol. It's just worsening this. And it is a very serious condition. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease can progress to another liver disease called non-alcohol steatohepatosis. NASH is the abbreviation. And NASH is associated with cirrhosis, and you don't want to get cirrhosis because if you get cirrhosis of the liver, you're going to be in liver failure and your health is just, it's terrible. And it's terrible to see people progress with cirrhosis. We see this with not only alcoholics, but also with people with fatty liver disease that don't get it under control. So get that liver under control, get rid of that congestion, get rid of that sluggish liver, lose weight if you have to, and then support your liver with these nutritional approaches. 
Rebekah Kelley: And are there any foods that specifically one should avoid?
Michael Murray: Anything that's a potentially harmful for the liver. High sugar, too much fat in the diet, particularly fried foods – fried foods are very hard on the liver – and then foods that are full of toxins, whether it be pesticides and other environmental toxins, or excessively cooked meat. Charred meat is really harmful. So eat organic, reduce your meat intake, and if you are going to eat meat, make sure you eat organic forms because, we focus a lot on organic produce, but the real problem is animals concentrate those pesticides even more. So we have to eat organic produce, but even more important is making sure we're eating organic eggs, free range, and making sure that we're avoiding dairy products that are non-organic. And then eating free range beef and non-antibiotic-treated livestock. 
So, those are some big things to avoid. But again, the key thing for non-alcohol fatty liver disease is to get your weight under control. PGX is, I think the magic bullet in helping people achieve and maintain their ideal body weight.
Rebekah Kelley: Wonderful. Thanks so much, Dr. Murray, those are really valuable insights.

Strategies to Improve Your Brain Health

Rebekah Kelley: Welcome to the Humanized Podcast, all about personalizing your health. I am your host, Rebekah Kelley. I'm so excited to introduce our guest today, Dr. Tom O'Bryan. But before I introduce Dr. O'Bryan, I want to remind everyone to subscribe to get all of our variety of casts in audio, video, and transcription at HumanizedHealth.com. I'd also like to thank our lead sponsor, Village Green Apothecary at MyVillageGreen.com.

A little bit about our guest. Dr. Tom O'Bryan is a recognized world expert on gluten and its impact on health. He is an internationally recognized and a sought-after speaker and workshop leader, specializing in the complications of non-celiac gluten sensitivity, celiac disease, and the development of autoimmune diseases as they occur inside and outside of the intestines. Thank you so much for being here with us. We really are excited to have you.

Tom O’Bryan: Oh, thank you, Rebekah. It's a pleasure.

Rebekah Kelley: Let's jump right into the conversation about brain health and ask, what triggers or impacts our brain function?

Tom O'Bryan: What's good to recognize is that the brain is the ""canary in the coal mine."" In the 1800s, coal miners would take a canary down into the mines with them with the canary singing in its cage. If they stopped hearing the canary singing, somebody would run over there right away. And if the canary had fallen over dead in the cage, they blew a whistle and everyone got out of there immediately – because there was methane gas leaking, or carbon monoxide gas, which humans can't smell, but it'll kill them. And so the canary in the coal mine is an early warning system.

Your brain is the canary in the coal mine of your body and your body's health. We all joke about it because we don't know what to do. ""So I'm getting old, I'm not remembering the way I used to."" Well, how old are you? ""Oh, I'm 34."" No, that's not supposed to happen.

Listen to this: Blue Cross Blue Shield published a report last year. Arguably they are the largest healthcare institution in the English language, I don't know about the world, but they are a multi-billion dollar profit-oriented industry offering health insurance. They published last year that between 2013 and 2017, in 4 years, there was a 406% increase in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's in 30 to 45 year-olds. 

But the concept is, an anti-inflammatory effort on your part pays big dividends. If this sounds too off for you, just Google ""depression and inflammation"" and you'll see the studies just start popping up. So many studies! Or Google ""schizophrenia and inflammation"" or ""brain fog and inflammation,"" and you start to understand the mechanism behind why all this is happening.

Rebekah Kelley: I just think, ""I'll go get a cup of coffee,"" but now I'm going to be thinking differently.

Tom O'Bryan: Well, you know, some people hear, ""Coffee is really good for you; it extends your life."" Some people hear, ""Coffee will kill you."" Well, what's the truth? The truth is if you carry a gene that makes you a slow metabolizer, meaning slow to break down chemicals in your body, the gene called CYP1A2, you really shouldn't drink coffee. If you have the slow metabolizer gene, caffeine has a much stronger effect on you. Studies show that when they screened tens of thousands of people, based on who carries the gene for a slow metabolizer and who doesn't, the slow metabolizers who drink one cup of coffee a day have a 15 to 20% increased risk of early death. Two cups a day, it's over 30%; four cups a day and it's over 60% increased risk of early death from cardiovascular disease. But only for those that carry that gene.

So how do you know if you're a slow metabolizer? Well, the genetic test is not hard to do. But if you've noticed that you drink coffee after a nice dinner at night, you eat at some nice restaurant or something, and you have a hard time sleeping that night, you're a slow metabolizer!

Rebekah Kelley: I should not be grabbing that cup of coffee from what you're saying...

Tom O'Bryan: Unfortunately, you may have to find an alternative for that, if you carry the gene. But there's no mystery about this. Once you learn how to identify what your body feeds off of very well, and what causes more inflammation in your body, it's not rocket science to have more of an anti- inflammatory life.

Rebekah Kelley: So obviously with coffee, it's going to depend on your DNA. But what about general toxins in the environment? Do they affect the brain and maybe affect everyone? How do those things affect us? How can we be on the lookout for them?

Tom O'Bryan: It's jaw-dropping when you learn about this. Arguably the number one medical journal in the English language for children's health is the Journal of Pediatrics. They published a paper; it was a policy statement. It wasn't just a summary of a couple of guys' research; it was a policy statement, which means it comes from the Board of the American Academy of Pediatrics. They want to make sure every pediatrician knows this. They said the Toxic Substances Control Act failed miserably to protect the health of our children; they added ""and adults,"" meaning all of us. Because the chemical industry paid off the lobbyists or the lobbyists paid off the senators and the representatives to pass this legislation that has no teeth, no teeth whatsoever.

And I'm going to give you another example. But before I give you the example, they said in that paper, that it's 247 pounds of chemicals per person, per day, that are being manufactured or imported into the United States.

Rebekah Kelley: I'm sorry?

Tom O'Bryan: 247 pounds per person per day.

Rebekah Kelley: So, I did hear you correctly!

Tom O'Bryan: That's five 50-pound bags every single day for every person in the US. It's 27 trillion pounds. But that number made no sense to me. So I divided it by 365 days. And then I divided it by the number of people in the US and it's 247 pounds per person per day. That's why newborn babies have, in the latest numbers, 283 chemicals in their bloodstream, in the
umbilical cord blood, that are not supposed to be there, at birth. And many of them are neurotoxins.

So if you take this concept of all these environmental toxins we're exposed to, and you think you're not exposed… the flame retardant chemicals on the sofa you're sitting on are outgassing into the air. You breathe them all day long. ""There is no evidence that the minor amount of flame retardant chemicals that leach out of your sofa is toxic to humans."" That's the legislation they had passed!

Or nail polish; the phthalates in nail polish. Phthalates are chemicals used to mold plastic. The phthalates in nail polish are in your bloodstream in 4 to 5 minutes. ""Now, there's no evidence that the amount of phthalates that leach out of nail polish into your bloodstream is toxic to humans.""

Or you store your leftover food in a plastic storage container in the refrigerator, and the next day you eat the chicken. The chicken now has phthalates in it from the plastic storage containers. ""Now, there is no evidence that the amount of phthalates that leach out of plastic storage containers is toxic to humans.""

But this stuff is a cumulative in your body. Give me 25 years of a little girl putting nail polish on her fingers and toes. Now here's the study. 2016. 346 pregnant women in Chicago. In the eighth month of pregnancy, they did urine analysis. What did they find? They measured five phthalates in the urine. Now there are hundreds of phthalates, but they just measured five. And they categorized them into fourths. The lowest fourth, the next lowest, the third and the highest. Then they followed the children of those pregnancies after they were born. And when the children turned 7 years old, they did Wechsler IQ tests on every single one of them.

What did they find? There's not much in medicine that's all or every. This was every; every child whose mother was in the lowest quartile of phthalates in urine in pregnancy, compared to every child whose mom was in the highest quartile, their IQ was seven points lower.

Now, seven points. That doesn't mean anything to people until you know that a one point difference in IQ is noticeable. Seven points of difference is the difference between a child working really hard, getting straight A's and a child working really hard, getting straight C's. That child doesn't have a chance in hell of ever excelling in school, because mom was high in phthalates that accumulate over 25 years.

Now, just go to Google and type in ""phthalates and neurogenesis,"" nerve growth. Here come the studies: how phthalates inhibit nerve growth. That's why 30 to 45-year-olds now have a 400% increase in Alzheimer's between 2013 and 2017. Because the brain is the canary in the coal mine, and we're accumulating all of these toxic chemicals in our body.

Rebekah Kelley: So I hope there's some sunlight at the end, and you're going to share with us what we can do to have better brain health.

Tom O'Bryan: You bet. The first thing is awareness. We all grow up believing, what do I take to fix this? What pill do I take? Or what food do I eat to fix this?
There is no pill. There is no food. You have to identify where you sit right now in this inflammatory scale. And then identify, where is the gasoline coming from? There is no other way to help ensure your brain is not going to be inflamed. You have to look at lifestyle and the environment you live in. If you've got mold in your house, you're throwing gasoline on the fire with every breath you take when you breathe in the mold. There's no simple way. I'm sorry; there's no simple pill. We always want to be told, this'll fix it for you.

The first step is awareness – and to have the OMG moment. When you have the OMG moment, then you want to learn more, and you start learning all of the little steps. Now, my book is really good for this. The book's called, ""You Can Fix Your Brain."" It's number one in seven categories on Amazon for brain function, because it's a really good book. It works; you learn all of this stuff, but there's no one simple thing.

Rebekah Kelley: Awesome. Thank you, Dr. O'Bryan. This has been very eye- opening. I am definitely going to get your book. I'm still digesting the poundage of toxins that I'm exposed to!

A little bit about our guest: Dr. Tom O'Bryan is a recognized world expert on gluten and its impact on health. He is an internationally recognized and sought-after speaker and workshop leader, specializing in the complications of non-celiac gluten sensitivity, celiac disease, and the development of autoimmune diseases as they occur inside and outside of the intestines.
Thank you so much for being with us, Dr. O'Bryan.

Tom O’Bryan: Thank you, Rebekah. It's a pleasure.

Rebekah Kelley: Today we're talking about immunity, which is a very important topic, especially with the pandemic. Having a strong immune system is important. So here is my first question: is a fever good or bad for you?

Tom O'Bryan: That's a really good question. Fevers are generated by your immune system. What I want everyone to remember is that your immune system is the armed forces in your body. It's there to protect you. There's an army, a navy, an air force, a marines, and a coast guard. We call them IgA, IgG, IgE, IgM... There are different branches of the immune system to protect you.

So, what is a fever? A fever is when your immune system says, there's too much of this bacteria, or this virus here. We need to ramp up the temperature a little bit because bacteria and viruses don't live in 101° or 102° or 103° temperatures. Fevers kill bacteria; fevers kill viruses.

So, in general, yes, fevers are a very good thing. There are so many studies that talk about this in the medical journals. You, of course, want to monitor a fever. You don't want it to be over 103° for a day. If it gets above that, or if it's there for too many days, you might want to bring some support in to bring it down a little bit. But 101°, 102, fine. Your body's doing its job, trying to get rid of a bad bug that got in there one way or another.

Rebekah Kelley: So, it's working like it's supposed to.

Tom O'Bryan: That's right. Now, sometimes it can get stuck, and it's ramping up too high, or it's not effective in getting the job done. Lots of reasons why that can occur and then you need to bring in some extra help.

Rebekah Kelley: So, it's actually working appropriately. Let's say we're running a fever, and we're a family. Obviously, we want to protect ourselves and build our immunity. Obviously, we can wash our hands to make sure that we're not giving it to others, but what else can we do to protect ourselves and our families?

Tom O'Bryan: If you've got a fever, there's something called the spleen pump technique. And it's just brilliant. This was published in 1952. In a hospital setting they chose, I think it was 70 people. They were in the cardiovascular ward, the liver ward, and the pediatric ward. They had done blood draws on them and they saw what their white blood cell count was. And they did this technique where you put your hands underneath the rib cage on the left side, right at the bottom of the rib cage, your hands are in the front and back. That's where your spleen is. And you just gently milk the spleen. You're just compressing the rib cage together just a little bit. With an infant, you're hardly moving at all; I've done this with newborns. It's extremely safe.

But with adults whose rib cages are more rigid, you've got to get in there and move it a little bit. The idea is you're milking it. You're just milking that side of the chest so that you're pumping the spleen.

They drew the blood on these people. They measured the white blood cell count. They did the spleen pump technique for 3 to 5 minutes, really gentle. And if you're doing it to a child, they're just looking at you goo-goo eyed, you know, there's no distress whatsoever. And then they waited 15 minutes and they drew the blood again. There was an average increase of 30% of the white blood cells in the bloodstream. 30% increase of the soldiers going out to fight whatever there is to fight. Why? Because your spleen is a reservoir, it holds extra blood. And what you're doing is saying, ""Come on guys, get out there and go to work!"" It's like, you're giving them a kick in the pants; go to work, get out in the bloodstream!

So it's a very gentle, safe technique that any mom can do with a child, any partner can do with their significnat other, their spouse. And it's always going to help; sometimes a little, sometimes a lot.

In my practice I've knocked out 105° fever. It was with my daughter; that's how I learned about this. My first year in practice, my wife called and said, our daughter has got 105° fever. So I just canceled the rest of the day. I went home. My wife had been cooking dinner, but she turned it off because our daughter was sick. I picked her up and put her on my shoulder; she was just dead weight, just limp. And she was really hot.

My wife had called the pediatrician. He hadn't called back. I'm walking around and saying, where's that doctor? Where's that damn doctor? Wait a minute; I'm a doctor! What would I do? I had just learned this technique the weekend before. So I did the spleen pump technique. My wife said, what are  you doing? I said, I just learned about this from Dr. Goodheart. I'm doing this very gentle technique. I picked my daughter back up and we walked around. And maybe 8, 10 minutes later, we walked through the kitchen and my daughter just leaped to grab the pot of spaghetti. She was really hungry! We kind of looked at each other... and her fever was 99°.

That's the first person I ever did it on. I've done it on hundreds of people now, in the last 40 years. Very safe. Very effective. Never going to hurt anybody.
Bottom of the ribs on the left side. Nice big wide hand contact front and back. Just gently milk it a little bit. It almost feels like you're not doing anything, but it might help.

Rebekah Kelley: Hopefully I won't have a fever, but I'm going to try that. What nutrients might help us maintain a strong immune system?

Tom O'Bryan: A really good question, especially during these trying times we have right now.

There are a few that a number of studies have talked about. The first one is zinc. Viruses have to get inside your cell in order to, well they don't really reproduce; it's called shedding. It's kind of like dandruff, you know, it falls off, so they're not reproducing. But to get more virus in your cells, or in your body, the virus has to get inside cells. If they get inside the cell, the amount of zinc inside the cell determines if they shed or not. And there have been a few studies on this that show, if you have high zinc levels inside your cell, the viruses are suppressed and they don't shed, or they shed minimal. So you want to have enough zinc, somewhere around 30 to 40 milligrams a day, a very safe amount. There are 18 different forms of zinc. Some are better than others, but any zinc is going to help. Just make sure you're getting some zinc first.

Next is vitamin C. Everybody knows that vitamin C helps the immune system. We've all heard that; for my entire life I've heard that. And some people say you can only absorb 500 milligrams a day of vitamin C. Well, one study was published in the 1980s and that's been disputed ever since. So I like to say, if somebody weighs about 130 to 140 pounds, about 5,000 milligrams of vitamin C a day. I take 8,000. It's just fine. Everybody's a little different, but it's very safe. But have vitamin C; have a good amount of vitamin C in your diet every day. It helps to support your immune system dramatically.

Next is vitamin D. With this current scare, there were 790 people in one hospital setting that were admitted to ICU. They checked their vitamin D levels. If their vitamin D was 19.5 or below, every one of them died. If their vitamin D was 31 or above, none of them died. So, there are many different things that come into play, in terms of how sick you get and how your body responds. But you just want to make sure your vitamin D level is robust. Not just normal, you want to be robust, and that's between 50 and 75 ng per mL. That's the classification system in the US, ng/mL. The goal is 50 to 75. Have your doctor do a blood test for you for vitamin D. And if they won't, then just order the finger prick tests, you can order it on my website. You poke your finger, put a drop on a card, send it off, and they send you the results. It's extremely accurate.

But find out what your level is now for you and your family. And if it's low, start taking vitamin D, somewhere around 2,000 IUs for every 50 pounds in weight, somewhere around there is extremely safe. So if you weigh 150 pounds, that would be 6,000 IUs a day. Do that for a couple of months, then stop the vitamin D for a few days and do a finger prick again, to confirm that you've got your level up. If there's one test that's more important than any other test that I can think of, much more important than cholesterol every year, much more important is your vitamin D level. Every year you do that. So we’ve got zinc, vitamin C, vitamin D.

Next, the rainbow diet. It's critically important that you eat all the colors of the rainbow in your food selections. The colors are called bioflavonoids and polyphenols – sorry for the geek term – but they inhibit the virus from getting inside your cells. Remember I talked about the virus has to get inside your cell to shed. And if you have a diet high in polyphenols, the [COVID-19] virus has a much harder time getting through the ACE2 receptor. That's how the virus gets into the cells: the ACE2 receptor. The polyphenols sit in that receptor so the virus can't get in. So eat red beets, and red raspberries, and green broccoli, and green parsley, and cilantro, and lettuce, and blueberries, and purple cabbage... You know, all of those colors of the rainbow. It makes a huge difference in the long-term, in strengthening your immunity and giving you protection.

Rebekah Kelley: Awesome. Are there any other nutrients that you want to increase, not just maintain to build immunity, or if you're feeling like you're coming down with something?

Tom O'Bryan: That's a really good question. Well, vitamin C is always safe. And actually, every patient, if they're coming down with something, I tell them to take 50,000 units of vitamin D once a week. So they ramp it up and we've never had a problem. It's extremely safe to do that. So vitamin C, vitamin D, and vitamin A is really important for your immune system function, especially for the lining of your lungs and the lining of your gut. Having adequate amounts of vitamin A is really important. So for that, eat sweet potatoes. Carrots are good; carrots are high in vitamin A, but don't just eat carrots or drink carrot juice, because you get too much of some of that stuff. Sweet potatoes are great for that, also.

Thank you so much Dr. O'Bryan, for being here with us. 
Tom O'Bryan: Thank you. Thank you. It's a pleasure. It's really a pleasure and thank you for what you're doing, carrying this message out to the world. 
Rebekah Kelley: Love it. Love sharing. I've just actually finished your book, You Can Fix Your Brain, and now I've opened it back up and I'm on reading it the second time. You have so much to share, so we're so glad you’re here to talk about this. 
Tom O'Bryan: I tell people, just open the book to any page, read one paragraph. If it doesn't grab you, don't buy the book. It should be that way. It should be, what? What did he just say? So, thank you. 
Rebekah Kelley: Thank you. So let's jump right in and give a little teaser. So what constitutes a healthy gut microbiome? 
Tom O'Bryan: What we have to understand is the importance of a healthy microbiome. 36% of all the small molecules in the bloodstream at any one time, over one-third of everything in the bloodstream, is the metabolites or the exhaust of the microbiome in the gut. I call it exhaust. But these bacteria produce metabolites and these metabolites go into the bloodstream – one-third of everything in the bloodstream. Why? They're messengers. And the messengers, we know for every one message from the brain going down, telling the gut what to do, there are nine messages from the gut going up, telling the brain what to do. The ratio is 9 to 1. That's why the gut is called the second brain. And those messages tell the brain, make this amount of neurotransmitter, brain hormones like serotonin, make this amount of melatonin, make this much brain-derived neurotrophic factor. All of these different hormones that balance the brain are produced in the volume that is controlled by the bacteria in your gut. So, if you have too many of the wrong type of bacteria in your gut, sending a whole lot of their messages, overpowering the messages coming from the good bacteria in the gut, you make too much imbalance of neurotransmitters in your brain, you get depression, or you get anxiety. Just go to Google and type in depression and brain function and look at all the studies that come up – because scientists are just blown away by this. 
So what makes a healthy gut? It's the balance of so many of the good bacteria and not too many of the bad bacteria.
Rebekah Kelley: So what factors can influence then, one's microbiome composition? 
Tom O'Bryan: Oh, it starts with being in mom's womb. We know now that mom's microbiome implants into baby in utero, so baby's initial bacteria in their gut are determined by mom. And that's why we talk about the generational influence on our health, that we can be carrying bacteria from mom, from her mother, from great-grandmother, that those concentrations of bacteria can influence how baby's brain is developing. So it starts in utero. Then the birth process, if you have a natural childbirth, we know in the last month of pregnancy, the bacteria in the vaginal tract completely changes and it becomes very dominant in something called Prevotella. Prevotella, and it's not hardly identifiable at any other time in a woman's life, only in that part of pregnancy in the vaginal tract. Why? Prevotella carries the messages as baby's coming down the birth canal covered in all of the juices of the reproductive tract. The bacteria is getting in the eyes and the nose and the mouth, baby swallowing it. And it's saying, okay, here's the code of the person who's going to be feeding you. So here's the code of the food that's going to be coming, so let's make these digestive enzymes, stomach and pancreas, let's start making these enzymes and bacteria in the gut. Let's start colonizing more of these. And that's what the bacteria in the vaginal microbiome does. 
So when baby is born by a natural childbirth, baby's getting the right messages. When baby unfortunately needs to be born by a Cesarean section, like our son – it was a traumatic birth and he's really healthy now, but at that time, a last-minute emergency, born by C-section – the microbiome that he was born with was highly compromised. The studies are really clear. If you're born by C-section, the microbiome that becomes dominant in baby's gut is the microbiome in the emergency room, in the operating room. And in hospitals, there's lots of bad bacteria, and it's in the air and it's on the gloves. They put clean gloves on and clean gowns, but they've got those bacteria that's in the room. And that becomes the dominant bacteria in baby at birth. So many babies are born with a deficit. 
Then, during the course of infancy and childhood, some babies, some children, require antibiotics for one reason or another. Antibiotics can be lifesaving. If they're important, you take them, but you have to recognize that the antibiotics don't just kill the bad bacteria. They also kill the good bacteria. And so if you have to take antibiotics, you need to do an aggressive approach to rebuild the natural microbiome. 
And then it goes on from there, with the foods that we eat, the house that baby lives in, the air that baby is breathing. There are so many influences on baby's microbiome that it takes mom or a family months to learn all of this and to begin adapting and transitioning their lifestyle to create a healthier environment for the family. You don't pick this up by taking one pill. Well, I'll take a probiotic. Well, that's going to help a little bit, but it doesn't fix everything. Right? So there's a whole game plan that you have to develop to rebuild a compromised microbiome or to maintain a healthy, balanced microbiome. 
Rebekah Kelley: Wow. So what is the best way then to test or understand your own microbiome? 
Tom O'Bryan: There are a number of good tests out there, but the bottom line is test the poop. Because... my mentor, Dr. Jeffrey Bland, and my friend, the founder of functional medicine, he says Tom, one teaspoon of poop has more bacteria than all the stars in the known universe. And he doesn't exaggerate. If we think of the numbers, that the best that we can do is look at, okay, what's the signature of this person's microbiome? Who are the dominant players? What are the most messages in the stool analysis that we're looking at?
So the test that we really like is called the Gut Zoomer because you zoom in on the problem. But there's a number of good tests out there that you can use. But the point is you have to check the poop to get an idea of what the environment in the gut is doing right now. 
Rebekah Kelley: So once you understand then your own microbiome, I'm assuming then you're going to tailor something to then fit what you need to do to optimize your microbiome health, right? How would you go about doing that?
Tom O'Bryan: The rule is, it's really simple and it's the basis of functional medicine. The rule is, get the bad stuff out and put the good stuff. If you don't know what's there, you don't know, and you shotgun. You go, well this is good. Studies say that this probiotic is good, let's give him some of that. And well, maybe we'll change it with this probiotic, let's give him some of that. And that's helped. I mean, I did that for many... You know, starting in 1980, when I opened my practice, we were talking about these bacteria with names like lactobacillus acidophilus and bifido bacteria. I mean, it's Greek. It's Greek. It sounds like Klingon language and you don't know whether to welcome them or shoot them. You don't know! But now we know more.
And so it's really important, if you have a health concern, that you get a big picture overview of what's going on in your gut right now. That's critically important. So once you understand it, you've got, oh look, it says that I've got too many families of bad bacteria, and they're really a strong message, which means their exhaust is getting into your bloodstream and they're sending messages to the brain, to the joints, to the skin, to your heart, directing a more inflammatory environment. And we know all disease, in all chronic diseases inflammatory in nature, well, if you want to deal with a chronic disease, irrespective of what it is, reduce the inflammation. And the first, the FIRST place you have to go for that is the gut. 
That's why at Harvard, our gastroenterologists and immunologists in the medical school are being trained right now. And the head, the chief of pediatric gastroenterology at Harvard just published a paper, All Disease Begins in the ""Leaky Gut."" All disease begins in the gut. That's how important it is to address the gut. That's why this topic is so critically important for everyone's health, for them and their family.

Thank you so much for being here with us. 
Tom O'Bryan: Oh, thank you. It's a pleasure. Thank you. 
Rebekah Kelley: So tell us about some of the ways the gut and the brain communicate with each other. 
Tom O'Bryan: Oh, my goodness, how much time do we have? [Laughs] The first way that the gut and brain communicate is that the bacteria in the gut, they're just like your muscle cells – you exercise too hard, you're sore from the lactic acid and that irritates the muscles. That every cell has an exhaust, when it works. The bacteria in your gut have an exhaust, it's called the metabolites of the bacteria. And over one third of all the small molecules in the bloodstream are the metabolites from the bacteria in the gut. It's, what? One third of everything in the bloodstream is the exhaust from the bacteria in the gut? Yes. Why? Well, that's the million dollar question. And it turns out that the bacteria in the gut – now here comes a geek word – modulates how the brain functions. Now, what does that mean? Modulates means you have your hand on the steering wheel, you're driving down the road, and if you turn the steering wheel five degrees to the right, 50 yards down the [road]... you're off the road! So ""modulates"" controls the balance of brain function, that the gut microbiome controls the balance of the brain hormones called neurotransmitters that your brain makes, that's regulated or modulated by the gut microbiome. That's that first way.
The second way is that... we learn this with Parkinson's, and the first studies came out about 2008, 2009, that Parkinson's patients, their disease starts 20, 30 years before they ever have a symptom. And it starts in the gut. That the misfolding of these proteins called alpha-synuclein, the twisting of these proteins occurs from the bacteria in the gut, too much of the wrong bacteria, bad bacteria. And this misfolded protein goes right through the walls of the gut into the tissue inside, and they grab onto the nerves in the gut and they creep up the nerves, neuron by neuron, like the itsy bitsy spider went up the water spout, that they creep up neuron by neuron. They don't go out to the side. This misfolded alpha-synuclein just goes up the neurons back into the spine, up the vagus nerve into the brain. And then it gets in the brain, and this misfolded protein has a magnetic pole to the area of the brain. It accumulates there, causes inflammation. Eventually the inflammation kills off brain cells. Here comes Parkinson's. So the bad bacteria in the gut, 20, 30 years before symptoms are producing the nasty that we all know is involved with Parkinson's, alpha-synuclein. So that's the second way. 
The third way is if you've got a leaky brain. Now, most people have heard of a leaky gut, so let me give you the analogy there. Mrs. Patient, your guts, 20, 25 feet long, kind of winds around in the center there and the inside of the gut, it starts at the mouth, goes to the other end, one big, long tube. The inside of the gut is lined with cheesecloth. So when you're eating food, you swallow food. It's in the tube, it's not in the body. Think of a donut. If you could stretch one donut way out and you look down the center of that donut, that's what your digestive tract is. So when you swallow food, it's in the tube. It's not in the body yet. It's got to go through the walls of the tube to get into the body. That's absorption of our vitamins and minerals, our proteins and fats and all that. How does that happen? Digestive enzymes act like scissors to cut it smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller until the molecules are so small, they go right through the cheesecloth into the bloodstream. But when you get tears in the cheesecloth, now you get bigger molecules getting through the tear before that food's been broken down small enough to get through the cheesecloth. Those molecules are called macro molecules, big molecules. They get in the bloodstream and they activate your immune system, say whoa, I better fight that! So that's what leaky gut is. And that's why the leaky gut is the gateway in the development of all chronic inflammatory diseases.
Now what you need to know about this is if you've got a leaky gut, the tissue that makes up the boundaries of the gut that open and close to let in little molecules and nothing bigger than that, those tissues, it's the exact same tissue that surrounds the brain. And so if you create a leaky gut and that's the proteins called zonulin, and if you have antibodies to zonulin, zonulin is also in the brain, the barrier of the brain. So when your body's making a leaky gut, it's also making a leaky brain. Now, when you get a leaky brain, you get bigger molecules in the bloodstream that aren't supposed to be able to get into the brain, but now they get into the brain. And then the immune system of the brain, trying to protect you, activates inflammation to kill those invaders. Now you've got inflammation in the brain. And then you get collateral damage in the brain and brain tissue starts being affected. 
So that's the process that goes on with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's and depression and anxiety and schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. That mechanism is similar in those different conditions. It just depends on what area of the brain is going to be affected. So the first thing you do with a brain dysfunction is heal the gut because when you're healing the gut, you're also doing the protocols to heal the blood-brain barrier. 
Rebekah Kelley: Awesome. So the microbiome's impact on the gut that then goes to leaky brain, right? Leaky gut, leaky brain. Then that is impacting mental health, right? 
Tom O'Bryan: Exactly. 
Rebekah Kelley: How does it do that? 
Tom O'Bryan: It's the inflammation in the brain. The first thing it does is the inflammation in the brain that causes the tissue not to function the way it's supposed to. And if you have too many of the wrong messengers modulating your brain function, you don't make enough serotonin or melatonin or GABA, or any of the brain hormones called neurotransmitters. They're just out of balance. And by definition, when they're out of balance, you've got brain dysfunction. It might be diagnosed as schizophrenia. It might be diagnosed... Just go on Google and type in schizophrenia and gluten and see all the studies that associate the two. And not every schizophrenia, but many of them, you put them on a gluten-free diet, they get better because gluten was the trigger for that person, creating the leaky gut and the leaky brain. And there's just so much to this field, you know, there's so much to learn, but first the big kahuna picture is that the gut has a direct impact on the brain. 
Rebekah Kelley: Wow. So how can you then optimize this gut-brain connection?
Tom O'Bryan: By healing the gut. Hippocrates said it thousands of years ago, heal the gut. And now at Harvard Medical School, they're doing the same thing. They're teaching the gastroenterologists that all disease begins in the gut, and in the leaky gut. All disease begins in the leaky gut. So you have to learn, okay, do I have a leaky gut? And when you find out you do, okay, how do I repair the leaky gut? And there's a long process. It's not a simple pill to take, you know? You can't take a pill and keep living the life you've been living, expecting a different result, right? Something about how we're living our life, the food that we're choosing, the air that we're breathing, something is triggering the inflammation that's causing the leaky gut, the leaky brain dysfunction. So you have to investigate, you have to identify what is it that for me or for my son or for my family in general, what is it that's contributing to the dysfunction that we're having? And you... oh my God, really? Mold? Yeah, my mold test came back positive. My husband's mold test came back positive. But we don't have any mold. Yes, you do. Did your basement ever flood? Well, yeah, that was 3, 4 years ago. Yeah. And the drywall in the basement got wet and the backside of the drywall that you can't see, grew mold. And so you're breathing mold.
Those are the types of things you have to investigate for. Are there food sensitivities, are there environmental sensitivities, is there too much... My son got really sick when he was 8 years old and we were trying to figure out why is he so tired, why is he so anemic, what's going on here? He had elevated antibodies to fibrinogen. That is really rare. And fibrinogen is a good thing. But he had elevated antibodies. Where'd that come from? My gosh. And so I'm investigating, investigating. He had high mercury, and mercury was causing the antibodies to the fibrinogen, which was causing the anemia, which was causing the fatigue. Mercury! Where did the Merc... oh my God, really? Really? And back then, this was in early 90s, we were just hearing that tuna tends to have mercury in it. Now all tuna, almost all tuna has mercury in it, unfortunately, but it's true. Back then, we were just hearing about this. And I realized, oh my gosh. When my son did something really good and he wanted a reward... what would you like Jason, this or this? And he always wanted to ride his bicycle up to the corner Subway and get a tuna fish sandwich, you know, a foot-long tuna fish sandwich. So he was getting that maybe once a week or something, I don't know, but it was the tuna fish that gave him the mercury toxicity.
My point is, the trigger in the outer world that's creating the inflammation in your body has to be looked for, investigated. That's what you have to do when you're dealing with a brain dysfunction problem. Where is the inflammation coming from?

Rebekah Kelley: Welcome to the Humanized podcast, all about personalizing your health. I am your host, Rebekah Kelley, and today I have with me our guest Dr. Tom O'Bryan on the show, and we'll be discussing Functional Lab Testing for GI Health. Before I introduce Dr. O'Bryan, I want to remind everyone to subscribe and get all of the variety of casts in audio, video and transcription at HumanizedHealth.com.

A little bit about Dr. Tom O'Bryan. He's a recognized world expert on gluten and its impact on health. He is an internationally recognized and sought-after speaker and workshop leader, specializing in the complications of non-celiac gluten sensitivity, celiac disease, and the development of auto-immune diseases as they occur inside and outside of the intestines.
Thanks for being with us, Dr. O'Bryan. 
Tom O'Bryan: Thank you. It's a pleasure to be with you. 
Rebekah Kelley: So jump right in. I just want to jump right in. How is functional lab testing different than conventional lab testing doctors tend to run? 
Tom O'Bryan: Conventional lab testing has been around for a long, long time, 30 years, 40 years, and it hasn't changed much as a general screen. We've got very sophisticated exams now, of course, that you can do with MRIs and things like that, but the regular testing of gut function is pretty much the same. The primary thing that's looked for is blood in the stool, and if that happens, then you go into much deeper exams. Not so much evaluation of your poop, but rather going and looking inside. 
Functional lab testing is completely different. It of course it looks for the emergency warnings, like blood in the stool, and every time we get some blood the stool, we send them for lower GI, immediately. Don't mess with this. Let's just rule it out to make sure there's no colon cancer starting, because it's such a common form of cancer. But functional lab testing looks at, how's it functioning in there? How is your gut microbiome, the bacteria that is so critically important? Do you have enough of the good guys? Do you have too many of the bad guys? What's the diversity? 
There's hundreds of different species that are supposed to be there, and some are supposed to be really dominant. We know the reason why some people can't lose weight, even if they eat really healthy food. One of the reasons why is they got too many of the bacteria that hoards calories. So it doesn't matter what you eat, your bacteria is going to hoard it and store it for future use, even though you're eating three meals a day. Because the bacteria doesn't know about that. The bacteria is the bacteria for those that lived in desert environments, like the Pima Indians. How did they survive out there? There's no crops growing out there. They had to have really efficient utilization of anything they could find to eat. And so they've got bacteria that's really high percentage that hoards calories. It's called Firmicutes and they hoard calories. Well, the Pima Indians today eat like the rest of us – potato chips, French fries – but their bacteria hoards calories. So their calorie-rich, nutrient-poor food – just like what's called the Standard American Diet, calorie-rich, nutrient-poor – but if you've got that kind of bacteria in your gut that's dominant, you're going to hoard those calories. So today 50% of Pima Indians by the age of 35 are obese and have type 2 diabetes. 50% of them! But it's because of your gut microbiome.
So we have to look and see how many of the good guys do you have, how many of the bad guys? We look to see, what's the pH? Are you making enough acid? If you have yeast infections, your pH has gone way up. And so if your poop is, the pH is really high, well, there's something going on in there. And then we should see some indicators of yeast also in that stool analysis. So there are many, many different things that we can discover by doing a stool analysis in a functional medicine approach. 
Rebekah Kelley: So what then are some of your favorite functional lab tests that you use with the patients, so you can understand what's happening in their GI? 
Tom O'Bryan: Over the years, technology keeps improving. What we're using now is called the Gut Zoomer because you zoom in on the problem, the Gut Zoomer. Very comprehensive overview. But the functional stool analysis are great. There's only one caveat that, when you do a stool analysis, to make it more sensitive, we often will induce diarrhea. You need to shake things up in there a little bit, and then you get much better representation of what's going on in there, as opposed to a standard stool analysis. Many doctors know about that, it's called a provocative challenge, to stir things up. But there are a number of them that are really useful and beneficial. We've used them over the years, on occasion we will, but the go-to right now is the Gut Zoomer. 
Rebekah Kelley: So what key things can you learn then, when doing functional lab testing?
Tom O'Bryan: Oh... well, we know that 36% of all the small molecules in the bloodstream come from the microbiome in your gut, the bacteria in your gut. So a third of everything in your bloodstream is... and that there are messengers going everywhere. Your heart, your heart rate rhythm is determined by the messages from the gut microbiome, your brain function, the brain hormones are determined by the gut microbiome.
So when we look at the gut microbiome, it gives us so much information about how your kidneys are functioning. Are they getting bad messages? Is the heart getting bad messages? Is your brain getting bad messages? Just go to Google and type in depression and inflammation and you see that every case of depression, every single one of them, unless there's an acute trauma or something like that, but long-term, every single case is an inflammatory condition. And that inflammation comes from the gut. Whether it's depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar, Parkinson's Alzheimer's - it's inflammation and the inflammation initiates in the gut. 
Rebekah Kelley: So then how do you tailor your recommendations, based upon this information that you're gathering?
Tom O'Bryan: Oh, right. So if you, for example, you have too much of the bacteria that hoards calories, you have to modify your food selections for a while. It takes anywhere from 3 months to 6 months to really turn around an established microbiome. So your food selections have to be a little different. There are some supplements that can help, it but depends. You don't want to eat a lot of starchy foods if you're hoarding calories because, well, sweet potatoes are supposed to be healthy for you. Well, of course they are. But you don't want to eat a lot of sweet potatoes if you've got a lot of Firmicutes because you're going to hoard all those calories.
So you want more vegetables and lean meats and quality meats, and fish. So it depends on what your results are. You really can't shotgun this so much anymore. You know, I grew up in the '60s in Detroit and the was a song, Shotgun. ""[Sings] Shotgun..."" It was a great song. And when I came out in practice, we were shotgunning probiotics into people, giving them lactobacillus and bifido because, well, they're supposed to help, and then the studies started coming out that it helps. 
You don't shotgun anymore. You look for the indicators of what specific probiotics supplements can be helpful for this individual, with what they're currently dealing with. My son unfortunately, was born by C-section, an emergency C-section, and so his microbiome was at a deficit to begin his life. He's 7 months old now, and he's healthy, everything's great. But I'm checking his microbiome and I'm determining what probiotics to give him on a monthly basis so that we're being tissue target specific. And the technology is now available to do that for all of our patients. And if we do the proper functional medicine stool tests, we get the information so then we then can determine what's the best supplement that's going to help you along with the dietary recommendations I'll give you today.

Dr. Joseph Pizzorno

Rebekah Kelley: Welcome to the Humanized Podcast, all about personalizing
your health. I am your host, Rebekah Kelley. I'm very excited to have Dr. Joe Pizzorno.

Before I introduce Dr. Joe, I want to remind everyone to subscribe to Humanized Health to get all of our variety of casts in audio, video and transcription at HumanizedHealth.com. I'd also like to thank our lead sponsor, Village Green Apothecary. Find them online at MyVillageGreen.com.

Our guest, Dr. Joe Pizzorno, is the founding president of Bastyr University. He is also the current chairman of the Institute of Functional Medicine and author of many top-selling books on evidence-based, natural medicine, including,  The Toxin Solution and The Encyclopedia of Natural Medicine. Having sold more than 2 million books, Dr. Joe will be talking on ""The Consequences of Chemically Grown Food,"" explaining how foods are the big drivers of toxins.

Welcome Dr. Joe. I want to point out that I have both of those books here, right off my bookcase. So I'm one of the 2 million who bought it! I use it so much; I'm grateful and appreciative. Thank you so much for bringing your knowledge, sharing it, and allowing someone like me to really understand, dive deep, and get to great health.

Dr. Joe Pizzorno: First, let me say thank you. That's great to hear. That's why Mike [Dr. Michael Murray] and I wrote the book. Part of the good news is that it's now been translated into six languages. Now we're not only helping English- speaking people, but people throughout the world.

Rebekah Kelley: Well, I'm grateful to you. I wanted to let you know, personally, it's impacted my life and made it so much better. I've shared it with friends and loved ones. I wanted to express my appreciation. It's quite an honor to be able to talk to you today.

We want to now focus on more knowledge that you can share. What is being done to our food, and what is it doing to us? Specifically, what chemicals have you examined in your research regarding farm-grown foods?

Dr. Joe Pizzorno: One of the challenges we have is that as we've started to use chemicals to both grow food in larger amounts and use less labor. There have been some unexpected consequences. The chemicals we're using are still in the foods.

These chemicals range from things that we can get rid of very easily, what we call non-persistent toxins, to some that are actually very persistent and very hard to get out of the body. An organically grown food has less metal, less chemicals, and more nutrients. Foods grown chemically have things like cadmium in them. They have organic phosphate pesticides (that are neurotoxins). They have organic chlorine pesticides (that are neurotoxins). I can go through the list, but as near as I can tell, about 60% of the toxic environmental metals and chemicals that people are exposed to today come from the food we are eating.

Rebekah Kelley: Are there some chemicals that are worse than others?

Dr. Joe Pizzorno: Yes, but it is difficult to answer that because there's a huge variance in people's susceptibility to toxins based on their genetics and based on the nutritional status. So for example, if a person is deficient in B vitamins, which is surprisingly common, arsenic is much more toxic to them.    That’s because we need methyl groups that are created by B-vitamins to get the arsenic out of the body.

Another group are the organic phosphate pesticides. These are neurotoxins. Some people have a deficiency in the enzyme glutathione in the liver that's responsible for breaking down those neurotoxic chemicals to get them out of the body.

So there are huge variations in genetics. I think that's one reason why the medical community has been slow to recognize these problems. They kind of look at generic information for the general population and say, well, for an average man, it's not that bad. But for specific individuals, they're terrible.

Rebekah Kelley: Right Outliers.

Dr. Joe Pizzorno: Outliers, yes. But it turns out that chemical use in food growth affects a big portion of the population. I would assert maybe as much as one half of all chronic disease is due to environmental toxins. So, if we can stop our exposure to these toxins, get them out of the body, we can make a huge impact on people's health.

Rebekah Kelley: Wow. It just kind of blows my mind. What has your research revealed about glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup? What is its impact on GMO foods or when it's used as a desiccant, or drying agent in oats and other grains?

Dr. Joe Pizzorno: I would recommend you read the research of Gilles-Eric Seralini, a PhD from France, who did important research on glyphosate and the industrial products using glyphosate. It's an important differentiation. Glyphosate as a chemical has some toxicities, not terrible; but glyphosate as an industrial chemical has a lot of toxicity.

So you look at the work of Dr. Seralini and he showed that while you have a certain level of toxicity with glyphosate, the actual industrial product is a thousand times more toxic.

Glyphosate safety was used to justify the product, but it's only 50% of the actual industrial product. And because of international treaties, the manufacturers do not need to disclose their trade secrets. Which is what that other 50% is. And it's way more toxic.

Rebekah Kelley: What do you think are the consequences of chemically grown food to human health or to livestock that may be consumed by humans?

Dr. Joe Pizzorno: Well, it affects virtually every disease. I think people are aware we're having an epidemic of diabetes in our country. When I was in naturopathic medical school, half a century ago, diabetes affected less than 1% of the population. I remember it took me one year in practice before I saw my first diabetic patient. You might say, well, young practitioner, not very busy... But I was fully booked within six months. Within a year, I had a three-month waiting list. People really wanted nutritional medicine.

So it took a year before I saw my first diabetic patient. Now the fact is about 10% of the population, and one out of every three people, are projected to get diabetes in their lifetime. What happened? Our genetics didn't change.

People like us, who are very nutritionally oriented, would say we're consuming too much sugar, right? Yes. We're consuming too much sugar.

But if you look at the growth of sugar consumption and look at the instance of diabetes, they don't correlate. We started consuming too much sugar decades before we saw the diabetes epidemic. So it doesn't correlate.

Then you say, well, what does correlate? Obesity? No question about it. Obese people have dramatically more diabetes; therefore, must be obesity.

But here's the kicker. Obese people in the bottom 20% of body load of environmental metals and chemicals, have no increased incidence of diabetes.

There. I just said, and everybody knows, obese people have way more diabetes. But if that fat is not full of toxins, they don't get the diabetes.

So I want to be clear. I'm not saying it's okay to be morbidly obese, as that will cause problems on its own. But as the explanation for the diabetes epidemic, no, it's almost entirely environmental chemicals and metals.

Rebekah Kelley: That blows my mind. I actually recently lost 20 pounds because I was becoming pre-diabetic. Suddenly my sugar was climbing; and I don't eat sugar, so it doesn't make sense. That's amazing. Wow. What a finding.

Can you compare and contrast the nutritional quality of chemically grown produce versus organic produce?

Dr. Joe Pizzorno: This is actually a little tricky. It's only been the last year that I've delved deeply into a pretty important factor. When we look at the vitamin and mineral content of organically grown foods versus chemically grown foods, it's clearly better. Not dramatically better, but clearly better. When we look at the research, comparing people who eat organically grown foods versus those who eat chemically grown foods, the organic eaters have  a lot of health benefits. The nutritional differences aren't enough to explain it.

As we were having this huge pandemic with COVID-19, I started delving into the research. Early on, there was some interesting research on the use of hydroxychloroquine with zinc in the treatment. While some of that research was showing that it didn't work early on, most of that research has now been retracted because it turns out it does work early on. Late disease - doesn't work. Early disease - does work.

The mechanism that was proposed to explain it was that hydroxychloroquine acted as an ionophore for zinc. What that means is, it helps the cells absorb zinc more efficiently. When zinc is in the cells, it stops the virus from taking over the cellular machinery to reproduce that virus. That, in essence, is one of the main ways to protect ourselves.

So then I was mentioning this to my friend, Dr. Michael Murray - who I hope you've interviewed because he's incredibly knowledgeable, that's why we've written 2 books together…

Rebekah Kelley: We have.

Dr. Joe Pizzorno: He said, ""Bioflavonoids do that, as well."" So that's interesting; bioflavonoids are antiviral. Bioflavonoids actually help take zinc into the cells.    Now look at the research on that. Of course, Mike was right. Then I thought, is there a difference in bioflavonoid content between organically grown foods and chemically grown foods?

The research I found was stunning. Many of the carotenoids and flavonoids that plants produce themselves to protect themselves from viral infections, bacterial infections, insects, cancer, ultraviolet damage from the sun... Well, when we consume those modules, they help us, as well.

So when you look at organically grown versus chemically grown foods, many  of these molecules are not only present in chemically grown foods at lower levels, some aren't even in them anymore. It turns out the molecules maintained were those to help give the food its characteristic color. But all the other carotenoids and flavonoids are so critical, not just for the plants' health, but for those of us who are eating those plants - they're gone. It's not only by means of minerals, it's lots of other molecules.

I've actually created a brand new lecture that I just gave for the first time a couple of months ago, entitled, ""Unimportant Molecules."" We have decided, inexplicably, that only less than 50 molecules of vitamins and minerals in food are important. We decided that 99.9% of these molecules in food are not important. Therefore, when they were lost from chemically growing, it doesn't matter because they were not important

It turns out they're hugely important. So going back to COVID-19, these molecules that normally help protect us from viruses both directly, by being antiviral and indirectly, by getting zinc into cells, they're not there anymore. So my prediction is more and more epidemics and pandemics because we've lost so many protective mechanisms.

Rebekah Kelley: Wow. They literally are the lost molecules and it's affecting us. That's amazing.

One last question. Can you compare and contrast the nutritional quality of livestock that has had chemicals added to their feed versus livestock that are not consuming chemicals in their feed?

Dr. Joe Pizzorno: I assume you could. I haven't looked at that research directly. I've just looked at the impact of what happens to people who eat these things. So I can't tell you.

Rebekah Kelley: Understand. Thank you so much. That was amazingly enlightening. My next question would be, in summing this up, what are the key takeaways that you would like our listeners or viewers to take away with them?

Dr. Joe Pizzorno: As you know, I'm a doctor. So I believe the body has tremendous ability to heal itself. If we just give it a chance. What does ""given a chance"" mean? We need to remove the blockages to cure. Okay. So what's that mean? Well, our bodies are enzyme machines. For them to work, you have to have the vitamins and minerals, but you have to avoid the toxins that poison enzymes, then our bodies don't work. When we look at how to live healthfully, we need to live a life where we limit our exposure to toxins as much as possible and eat foods that are rich in nutrients.

So how do you do that? You want to eat organically grown foods, preferably grown from heirloom seeds. As we've modified our food supply to give more of one particular molecule, like more protein, for example, then necessarily the plant is going to produce less of other molecules that we didn't think were important.

So if I said, "" Wow, this tastes good."" That's because it has all these molecules that are important. Our bodies are sensing more than just salt and things like that. We are actually able to detect a lot of other factors. So bottom line: Get nutrients in, keep toxins out.

Rebekah Kelley: It seems so simple when you put it like that. Thanks, Dr. Joe. These are really valuable insights.

Before I introduce Dr. Joe, I want to remind everyone to subscribe, to get all of our variety of casts in audio, video, and transcription at HumanizedHealth.com. I would also like to thank our lead sponsor Village Green Apothecary, at MyVillageGreen.com.

Our guest, Dr. Joe Pizzorno, is the founding president of Bastyr University, current chairman of the Institute for Functional Medicine and author of many top-selling books on evidence-based natural medicine, including ""The Toxin Solution"" and ""The Encyclopedia of Natural Medicine,"" and has sold more than 2 million books. Dr. Joe will be talking on the consequences of chemically grown food, and how food is our biggest driver of toxins.

Welcome Dr. Joe. You've done a deep dive into the negative impact on human and animal health of chemically grown food. Today I want to focus on our strategies for detoxification and clean eating. So how important is eating organically grown and non-GMO foods for health?

Dr. Joe Pizzorno: You can't overstate how important non-GMO foods are. It's      not just that they have higher levels of nutrients, but they also have much lower levels of toxins. And they have much higher levels of all these other factors in foods that we're now finding are important.

You have to realize that vitamins and minerals were first determined to be important in humans starting around 100 years ago. At that time, the technology that was available was fairly limited. Now that we have better technology available, we're finding there are many more molecules in food that are important. A lot of these important molecules for food have been lost from the food supply. So let's go back and look at what are the worst toxins, what's causing the most damage to the body, and where are they coming from. I'll start with two that are really scary.

The first one is arsenic. So if you look at the CDC, the Centers for Disease Control, they list what are the worst environmental toxins. Arsenic is number one. So when I saw that, I was kind of like, well, why is arsenic number one? I started looking at the research. And it was very, very worrisome. I mean, frankly, scary. There’s a study that was done with Native Americans. So, it's possible their genetics may be different from other genetic backgrounds, but it's a good study. And they looked at 4,000 of them. And what they did is they looked at their arsenic levels. And what they determined was that the arsenic levels that they had accounted for one quarter to one third of the major cancers. We're talking about lung cancer, and pancreatic cancer, and prostate cancer; these are the cancers that tend to kill people. Okay, and they found that one quarter to one third were due to arsenic. Well, that’s very worrisome.

And then the other study, and this was looking at lead, [both] cause mortality and cardiovascular disease. And they determined that lead accounted for 18% of all-cause mortality. And one third of death from cardiovascular disease.

Again, this is what kills people, two toxins: arsenic and lead. So it turns out it's not just our food supply that is contaminated with these things, it's in the water. And if you look at people in the age group where most disease starts showing up, in the 50s and 60s, think about what other thing also happens during that time. People tend to lose bone. What is stored in bone? So now you're going to get all this lead and I start seeing all this disease coming up.

So, it turns out that a lot of the disease that we see now is not preordained. We're not genetically designed to get a lot of disease, but rather we've so disrupted our physiology that we're getting a lot of disease. We're seeing more chronic disease in every age group ever in human history. Well, we need to do something about that.

So how do you live a life as low in toxins as possible? I'll walk you through our house. So, we're going to come to the front door. The first thing I'm going to do is ask you to take off your shoes, because those shoes are tracking in toxins from the environment.

And if you live anywhere near a farming community, it's full of dust in that air around there; it's full of pesticides. Okay. So you take off your shoes.

Then you walk in and let's see what your kitchen looks like. Walk in the kitchen; open the refrigerator door. There's no plastic in there. It's all glass. All the storage containers are glass. Okay. Because those plastic containers leak bisphenol A, or all bisphenols, I should say. They're now replacing bisphenol A with other bisphenols that are every bit as toxic, as near as I can tell. And anyway, they leak thiolates when they're in the food, as well. So we don't have plastic containers.

Look at our cookware. There's no nonstick cookware. If you get the nonstick cookware it means, yeah, the food doesn't stick to the pan, you might say.
But the pan does stick to the food. You eat that food, you'll eat what are called PFOAs. Okay. These are perfluoro compounds; they are endocrine disruptors. So, no nonstick. Okay. Then, of course, that food that we're putting in there is all organically grown.

Then how about the water? You cook with the water that you're drinking. So we have a carbon block filter for all the water coming into our house. Now, if you can't do that, you can use something called the Zero Filter. I have no commercial relationship with them, but I just looked at the research and it does a good job of taking the garbage out of the water. The water’s clear.

How about the air? So, if you have a forced-air heating system, replace your filter with a filter rated at least Merv 12. Now we have a Merv 16 in our house. It clears the garbage out of the air, all the particulate matter, VOCs and things like this, compounds in the air. So by putting in a really good filter that runs 24/7, it's always running, it clears the air. And by the way, when we did this, we did it about 3 years ago, we were stunned—our house isn't dusty anymore. Because we cleaned the air so well! It's quite remarkable.

Rebekah Kelley: That's a wonderful benefit too, though. Less housework!

Dr. Joe Pizzorno: Because otherwise your lungs are cleaning that stuff. No, I mean, I'm here talking to you from Seattle. The last few years, there's been a bunch of forest fires here lately. Very sad, along the West coast. So, these filters are so good that in our house, you can't smell the smoke. You open the door and it's like, ""Whoa, who just lit a match in my face?"" So, kind of look at every way in which you're exposed to toxins, and decrease it. We can't control everything. But we have to control what we CAN control, and you can get your body load down.

It's surprising, by just eating organically grown foods, you can decrease your body load of these persistent toxins, at least in the blood, within just a few days. Now, of course, the fat-saturated toxins can take much longer, but at least you can get the blood levels down right away. I can keep talking, but I think I've tried to answer your questions.

Rebekah Kelley: That was amazing. It's almost, like, you have to become a defender of your home, right? Literally, for each and every place and parts, and all the way down to the water, the air you're breathing, every single thing that you're using.

Well, that actually ties perfectly into the next question. Should we be paying attention to the ingredients in our nutritional supplements and our body care, since we do absorb that. Obviously, we're taking it in and our skin absorbs whatever we put on it.

Dr. Joe Pizzorno: Right. So health and beauty aids are a major source of phthalates. Phthalates are a chemical put into health and beauty aids to help with their oiliness, you might say, and also to stabilize the fragrances. Okay. Well, those phthalates are endocrine disruptors that directly correlate with diabetes. So yes. Get clean health and beauty aids. And the good news is, there are a number of apps available. Just take a little picture of the barcode and it'll tell you what's in it. So more and more companies are producing health and beauty aids without these toxic chemicals in them. Really, really important.

Rebekah Kelley: I believe if you can't eat it, you shouldn't be putting it on your skin.
Dr. Joe Pizzorno: Great. True.

Rebekah Kelley: Truly clean. Do clean, whole foods retain phytochemicals that assist our body in detoxification?

Dr. Joe Pizzorno: Yes, they do. Now a number of these molecules are heat and air sensitive. So, you realize that when you cook your food or if you store it for long periods of time, these things will tend to go away. Some are quite stable. Others are very fragile. We are now doing more and more green drinks, which is pretty exciting. We get out the Vitamix, we put in vegetables and some fruit to make it tasty, etc. And I've been kind of doing a little personal experiment. So we make it the right away. We taste to see what it tastes like; it tastes pretty good. Now we put it in the refrigerator. Taste again in an hour; it tastes different. The number of these molecules are either volatile, they evaporate off, or because the cells have now been broken apart, the enzymes are starting to break these things down.

Sometimes it breaks them down to beneficial things like cabbage family foods. So those glyco scintillates need to be produced by the cells. So if you cook cabbage, you'll lose a lot of them. So when you eat the cabbage raw or you juice it, these things are really strong, but they go away very, very quickly. And then I try to taste. What's it taste like a day later? These green drinks taste totally different a day later. It is just fascinating. So these molecules, they are fragile. So the fresher your food, the more raw you eat it, the better you're going to be.

Rebekah Kelley: So, detoxification is a broad and complex topic. Can you suggest a few key strategies for our listeners?

Dr. Joe Pizzorno: Sure. So here's my commercial break; my book, ""The Toxin Solution,"" tells you how to do it. A concern I have is now people are becoming aware of how problematic environmental toxins are. They tend to go on detox programs. Now conceptually, that is a great idea. But if your organs of elimination, what the naturopaths call the emunctories, aren't working properly, stirring up those toxins without being able to get rid of them is not a good strategy.

Rebekah Kelley: Creating a storm, right?

Dr. Joe Pizzorno: You can make things worse. I mean, there is plenty of research on that with highly toxic populations. If you do put them on a fast, you start breaking off fat real quick. It is way more toxic. Okay. So I go through kind of a three-stage process. Well, four stages.

Stage one is stop the toxins coming in. No point going on a detox program when the toxins are still coming in. 

And then the next day, just clean up the gut. Because our guts now have so many inappropriate bacteria in them that are producing toxic molecules, the liver is being overloaded, trying to deal with the toxic molecules from wrong bacteria in the gut. So it has less capability to deal with the chemicals we're being exposed to. Clean up the gut.

Then we have to get the liver working properly. And it turns out getting the liver working properly means make sure the nutrients necessary for the liver enzymes to work are there at high levels, like B vitamins.

Next, we have to get the kidneys working properly. We're having a kidney failure epidemic. I never saw people with kidney failure before. Now it's all over the place. So now I have to get the kidneys working properly. It turns out a lot of the problems with the kidneys are due to impaired blood supply    to the kidneys. So that's where things like green drinks with beet juice in them, and with blueberries in them, help improve the blood supply to the kidneys so they can detoxify more effectively.

Rebekah Kelley: So, it's about how you do it.

Dr. Joe Pizzorno: Repair the body!

Now, once the body is repaired, something I really liked doing, that many people do, is saunas. So, saunas. If you look at the sweat and the sauna, and you want to learn more about that, look at the great research by Stephen Genuis, a doctor up in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

They've done a lot of great work where he takes people, puts them in a sauna, scrapes off their sweat to see what's in it—full of toxins! As a matter of fact, there are toxins in the sweat that don't even show up in the blood and the urine. It's so bad for the body, the body sequestered them, tried to put them away, keep them out of circulation.

Now we've got a chance to get rid of them. Well, let's do that. So start as I recommend to people; sweat heavily for at least 20 minutes, use whatever temperature you like. Sweat heavily for these 20 minutes, at least twice a week. Even once a week will be helpful. And, of course, drink plenty of fluids. I recommend also slightly alkalinizing fluids because if we alkalize the body a little bit, it's easier for the kidneys to get rid of the toxins.

Rebekah Kelley: I love a good sweat. I'll follow that for sure.

Dr. Joe Pizzorno: And by the way, it doesn't matter how you sweat. It could be a sauna, it could be running; it doesn't matter, as long as you're sweating.

Rebekah Kelley: Are there a few important nutritional supplements that you consider essential in this regard?

Dr. Joe Pizzorno: So, if a person could only take one supplement, I would recommend N-acetylcysteine, or NAC for short. And the reason for that is there's a critical molecule in our bodies called glutathione. Glutathione both protects us from oxidative damage from these environmental toxins, but also helps many of them get out of the body. So it plays a big role and getting rid of mercury. It plays a big role in Phase II conjugation to get the chemical toxins out through the liver.

The levels of glutathione in the body are determined by how fast the body is producing it, and by how fast the body's recycling after it's done this job. The rate-limiting step in the production of glutathione is an amino acid called cysteine. You can't take cysteine by itself because it'll be broken down by bacteria in the gut. So by taking N-acetylcysteine, we're able to absorb it.

So, 500 milligrams of N-acetyl cysteine twice a day will increase the blood levels of glutathione by about 30%. So this is by far the most effective supplement I know for detoxification.

The second one, which is very important obviously, maybe, I don't know, might be more important, is fiber. So when our bodies get rid of toxins through the liver, they're typically dumped into the gut, where our bodies are expecting those toxins to now be bound to fiber, to get out through the stool. Those systems evolved when we were consuming 100 to 150 grams of fiber a day. Now a person consumes 15 to 20 grams of fiber a day. So a lot of the toxins that normally would have been excreted are now reabsorbed through something called enterohepatic recirculation. So basically we sabotage a key detox system when we go on a diet low in fiber.

Rebekah Kelley: That rings so true to me. Yes. Fiber. Wow. Thank you so much, Dr. Pizzorno. That was again, even better than I expected. You blow my mind. So thank you. And just for our three to four key takeaways that you want to imprint on our listeners and viewers’ minds, what would you want to leave behind for them?

Dr. Joe Pizzorno: My belief, looking at a lot of research and treating a lot of patients, is that toxins have now become the primary drivers of chronic disease. Not the only ones, but they have now become the biggest ones. Nutritional deficiencies, nutritional excesses, those problems have not gone away. We just added another problem.

So, key strategy, don't let these things into your body. Some are easy to get rid of, like arsenic for example. But some, like cadmium, are almost impossible to get rid of. The half-life of cadmium in the body is 16 years in the kidneys. And they are a major cause of the kidney failure epidemic we are seeing.

But there are other chemicals like PCBs, polychlorinated biphenyls. Now, they were banned over 40 years ago, which is great. But they're called persistent organic pollutants, or POPs for short, because they were designed to be difficult to break down. So again, in human bodies, the half-life of these PCBs ranges from 2 to 20 years.

And it takes four half-lives to get it out of the body. So a lot of these chemicals we're getting, they're almost impossible to get rid of, and they cause disruption of, for example, the thyroid. PCBs are a major cause of rheumatoid arthritis in women. I can show you a list of all the problems with these chemicals that we're being exposed to.

So one of the most important life promotion, health promotion, anti-aging strategies is: don't let the toxins into your bodies. Our bodies have a tremendous ability to heal, but if you poison the enzyme systems, they can't function.

Rebekah Kelley: So, defend yourself against those toxins in any way you can. Thank you, Dr. Joe. That was just, that was incredibly valuable. Dr. Joe can be found again at DrPizzorno.com.

Rebekah Kelley: Welcome to the Humanized podcast, all about personalizing your health. I am your host Rebekah Kelley, and here to share his knowledge today is Dr. Joseph Pizzorno, about Unimportant Molecules. And before I introduce Dr. Pizzorno, I want to remind everyone to subscribe to get all of our variety of casts in audio, video and transcription at HumanizedHealth.com. I'd also like to thank our lead sponsor, Village Green Apothecary, at MyVillageGreen.com. 
A little bit about Dr. Pizzorno. He is a world leading authority on science-based natural medicine. He's a naturopathic physician, educator, researcher, founding president of Bastyr University and the current chair of the board of the Institute for Functional Medicine. He is also the author of numerous books, including the Textbook of Natural Medicine, and most recently, The Toxin Solution, of which both I have. Great books. So Dr. Pizzorno is an expert in toxins and detoxification, and we're thrilled to have him here today to talk about the consequences of chemically grown food, but I guess that's related more to the unimportant molecules. So, thanks for being here. 
Joseph Pizzorno: Thank you for the kind introduction and invitation.
Rebekah Kelley: And my first question is what are unimportant molecules? Cause it sounds unimportant, but you're here to talk about them. So they must be important. 
Joseph Pizzorno: Yeah. Sorry, being a little facetious there. So let's go back a hundred years ago when the researchers were first studying nutrition, trying to figure out what in food was important. And they were limited by both the technology at the time, but also by our limited understanding of physiology. So they were doing animal research and they were pretty much looking at, well, what's in food that's necessary for animals to stay alive. And they started looking at, they're finding these minerals and they're finding these things they called vitamins. And they're finding these amino acids that are necessary and fatty acids that are necessary, and kind of step by step, as you kind of look at the research, year by year, decade by decade, they're finding these vitamins and minerals and things, and came up with 43 minerals and molecules that are necessary for life. And that was fine.
And then they decided, okay, so as long as food has these minerals and molecules in it that we know are necessary for life, then when we start growing foods, chemically, as long as we're maintaining a reasonable amount of these nutrients, well we should be just fine. But there was a problem. And that is, they were looking at only what nutrients were necessary for life. They weren't looking at what was necessary for health because that was a much harder thing to measure. So, then you started looking at more modern research and we started looking at, well, how many molecules are actually in foods? You want to guess how many molecules are in food?
Rebekah Kelley: Probably a ridiculous number, right? So much more than 52, or however much they... 
Joseph Pizzorno: Right? So it's 43 was what they came up with as being necessary. Okay. 50,000. So we decided that 99.9% of the molecules in food were not important. So when we grow foods chemically and they're lost, nobody worried about it. But now we're doing research, kind of backfill, and we're realizing, wait a minute. A lot of these molecules were actually very important. So even though the researchers a hundred years ago said they were unimportant, now we know they're important. 
So people now talk about things like these super, super nutrients. You've heard about phytonutrients, and experiments are being done with humans who were given these molecules and they do better. And it's, oh, isn't this a wonderful new thing. Well, it was in the food to begin with and then we lost it. 
So let's look at some examples where that's important. Let's look at this pandemic we're having with COVID-19. What people don't realize is that when foods are grown properly, they are full of flavonoids that are antiviral. The foods produce these antiviral molecules to protect themselves from viruses. And they produce antibacterial molecules. They produce molecules to protect themselves from ultraviolet, they produce molecules to protect themselves from becoming cancerous – and all these molecules were not considered important.
So we're saying, well, look at these wonderful things we should now be taking as supplements, and that's fine, but they should have been in the food supply to begin with. 
So there was a study that really grabbed my attention. The study was done where they're comparing chemically grown foods to organically grown foods. And in particular, they did this with tomatoes and did it in a greenhouse. So they had a totally controlled situation, same sun, same amount of water, same seeds, same soil. The only thing was different was putting chemicals on, versus natural things. And then over a year's period of time, they looked at the levels of these various molecules in foods. And what they found was that the chemically grown foods either had dramatically lower levels of these molecules, or they weren't even there at all. So the molecules that were being conserved, that were considered important, were the ones that typically give the food its characteristic color. Okay, so tomatoes are still pretty much red, but all those other molecules that are so important for health, they're not in the tomatoes anymore. 
So what does that mean for our health? So you look at chronic disease after chronic disease, right now we suffer the highest burden of chronic disease in every age group ever in human history.
Something's wrong. And it turns out with these major diseases, not only are the environmental toxins causing these diseases, but we've lost our protection from many toxic molecules because these molecules that are supposed to be healthy for us in the food supply, they're not there anymore.
Rebekah Kelley: So, I know you mentioned that they were grown with chemicals, but is that, I mean... why have they left the food supply? Is it only because of that or are there other ways that we're doing... but what's causing it? 
Joseph Pizzorno: So there are many reasons, both overt and subtle. Let's look at some examples.
So for example, we, with our growing techniques, have constantly hybridized our foods and now we're doing genetic modification to induce in the foods more of some particular molecules that we want. So we want the food to be sweeter. We want it to be bigger. We want it to have more protein. Where every time you modify a food and select particular seeds to create some particular characteristic. Well, guess what? Many of the other ones are going to become less because the plants can only produce certain levels of these molecules. 
But it gets worse. So when you now grow plants in a chemically controlled environment where you're now spraying them with chemicals to protect themselves from insects, well now they don't need to produce those molecules themselves to protect them from the insects. Well, many of those molecules have a lot of beneficial effects in the body and for humans, but they're not there anymore.
Let's go even further. How about glyphosate? People know about Roundup being sprayed on plants to kill off the weeds and we're now making, with GMOs, making plants resistant to glyphosate. Okay, well, that's fine. And you look at research on humans and with glyphosate and it has some toxicity, it's not terrible, but it's really toxic to plants that aren't protected by genetic modification. So it does that by poisoning something called the shikimate pathway. The shikimate pathway is necessary for plants to grow. And interestingly enough, many of these phenols, many of these flavonoids that are so important, depend upon the shikimate pathway to grow, to be produced. So now we give the plants glyphosate, they can't produce many of these important molecules. You look at example after example where we've modified our food supply to produce a whole lot more food, but that food is a shadow of itself of what it should be for our health. 
You can try an experiment yourself. Go to the grocery store – now it's going take a little while to get this done, because when you hear what I'm going say at the end – go to the grocery store and buy a chemically grown tomato. That's the old conventionally grown tomato. Taste it. Not a lot of flavor. Then you buy an organically grown tomato. Wow, that's way better. Now grow a tomato in your own backyard and see what it tastes like. It's even better than organically grown tomatoes. So when you say it tastes better, what does that mean? There's more molecules in the food that our body is sensing. Therefore, it tastes better because, oh, wow, there's a lot more taste sensations, rather than with these anemic, chemically grown tomatoes. There's not a lot there. No. It's got the color, it's got some of the taste, but the substance is just not there. And that lack of substance, that lack of these interesting tasty molecules is having a real big, negative impact on our health.
Rebekah Kelley: There's definitely a big difference with tomatoes. I mean, I'm glad you used that as an example. Cause I've had a gazpacho made out of chemically grown tomatoes and it's not a gazpacho. I don't know what it is, it definitely looks like a gazpacho, but it doesn't taste like one. Not really.
Joseph Pizzorno: You can add a lot more spices, to cover up the lack of taste from the food.
Rebekah Kelley: And I didn't understand why, but that makes so much more sense, the way you describe it. Of course my mouth is like, yeah, that doesn't have what I need in it. Right. So why does their loss cause disease? 
Joseph Pizzorno: So there are just many, many examples, both kind of direct and indirect. A big one is, I think everybody is now aware of oxidative stress, free radicals, things like that, that cause so much trouble. So how do the plants protect themselves from the same oxidant molecules? It's with these carotenoids and flavonoids. But when you grow the foods chemically, you don't have as many of those antioxidants. So you might say, well, is this particular nutrient, molecule deficiency associated with this exact disease?
Well, there's some of it, but more importantly, it's associated with pretty much ALL disease because almost all disease has oxidative stress associated with it. So we basically made our bodies less resistant to all these diseases. 
I was just not ready to show recently, where I was asked to predict the future – there was a lot of discussion about the Delta variant to the COVID -19. And I said to the radio audience, I said, well, you want to know what the future is? If we continue not taking care of our health, if we continue to have really weak immune systems, we're going to have more and more epidemics and pandemics. So you don't like masking up now? You don't like taking this experimental vaccine? Well, guess what? If we as a society don't fundamentally change how we're living our lives, we're going to be in lock-down with masking and vaccinations more and more and more. So this should be a wake-up call for people. You can't expect these medical interventions to take the place of being healthy. I'm not anti-vaccination, but people need to realize and not over-expect what vaccinations can do. All the vaccinations can do is protect you from one particular organism and from one particular variant of that organism. Well, guess what? These organisms keep mutating to get around that, and it'll keep happening. The most effective way to protect ourselves is with a good immune system. 
Rebekah Kelley: Which is based on the foods that have the ""unimportant molecules."" 
Joseph Pizzorno: Right. Based on foods rich in nutrients, unimportant molecules, and avoiding the environmental toxins that damage our immune system. Our immune system is extremely susceptible to damage from the metals and chemicals, which area leaked into our entire environment.

Rebekah Kelley: Welcome to the Humanized podcast, all about personalizing your health. I am your host, Rebekah Kelley, and today we'll be discussing the Benefits of Herbal Compounding for GI Health with Dr. Courtney Roberts. Before I introduce Dr. Roberts, I want to remind everyone to subscribe and get all of our variety of casts in audio, video and transcription at HumanizedHealth.com. I'd also like to thank our lead sponsors, Village Green Apothecary, at MyVillageGreen.com. 
So, a little bit about Dr. Courtney Roberts. She received her naturopathic medical degree from Bastyr University. While there she gained an intense interest in the gastrointestinal system, women's health, metabolic and endocrine disorders, and chronic pain while witnessing the profound shifts that occurred in her patients' well-being with the use of individualized and evidence-based botanical, nutritional and lifestyle medicine in her clinical practice. Dr. Roberts focuses on uncovering the hidden environmental and infectious triggers as root causes of many common chronic diseases and she's utilized her extensive botanical formulation experience to provide individualized herbal compounds to treat the whole person.
Thank you, Dr. Courtney, for being here with us. 
Courtney Roberts: Thank you so much. I'm happy to be here. 
Rebekah Kelley: So, I just want to jump right in and ask you. The first question, of course, is why is GI health so important when it comes to total body health and wellness?
Courtney Roberts: Well, the GI system is huge. First of all, it's composed of 10 different organs in and of itself. And then on top of that, there are other systems. So we have the nervous system, the circulatory system, that play a role in GI function. There's processes like macro- and micronutrient absorption, which without these nutrients, our body has no fuel, it can't do all of the processes that it needs to do. There's digestion, there's waste elimination, immune function, blood sugar and hormone regulation, detoxification. And then of course, the microbiome, which is like, what does the microbiome NOT do at this point? We're learning things every single day about what the microbiome does and it's way more than just digestion.
So all in all, I would say that the GI system just has a ton of functions and a ton of areas that something can go wrong, by default. And there's a lot that we can do in those areas that something goes wrong. So really you can't have a healthy body, you can't have a healthy brain, you can't have healthy skin, you can't have a healthy immune system or any of those other processes without having a healthy GI system. And you really can't. It's going to be really hard to feel good without having a healthy GI system. 
Rebekah Kelley: So then how are conventional doctors and their treatment approaches often missing the root cause of their patient's GI distress? I mean, you just mentioned all of these systems and frankly, whenever I go see my general practitioner, we may focus on one of those, but we definitely don't focus on all of those. There's got to be something that's definitely being missing in the process, right? 
Courtney Roberts: Yeah. Yeah. For sure. Unfortunately, I don't think it's intentional at all. I just think it's how conventional doctors are trained. So for one, not really asking enough questions to the patient. They're not asking about diet and lifestyle – because we really need to know what are the obstacles to cure. So what are the things that you are doing every single day? What are you eating, where you're eating multiple times a day. What are you constantly doing? How are you exercising? How are you sleeping? How are your bowel movements? Just things that are habit that are contributing to your overall health and well-being and kind of adding insult to injury if we are not addressing them in the first place.
So, I would say not having adequate training in nutrition and the effects of diet on disease, as well as the effects of the lack of certain nutrients and certain foods and how that can contribute to disease. 
Secondly, I would say that the testing is probably not comprehensive enough. So although it's very technologically advanced… when I'm ordering conventional testing and conventional imaging, I'm looking to rule out certain things and I'm looking to rule in certain things. So I'm looking for, let's say, IBD, Crohn's or colitis, I'm looking for cancer, cirrhosis, whatever it may be. But after those things are ruled out, conventional doctors, there's just not really much else that they are trained in, to know what to do next. So, the problem is really like, okay, well, I guess there's nothing wrong if we can't find it on this test – which is a little troublesome because obviously if your patient is feeling bad, then there is something wrong.
So, it seems like it's only considered a disease if there is a drug or a surgery to treat it. And we know that the human body is really a lot more complex than that. 
Rebekah Kelley: Right. So you mentioned what lab testing you might take a look at, depending upon what issues a patient's dealing with, but that kind of gets me to what functional lab testing do you recommend when patients do present with GI symptoms? What would those tests be with you? 
Courtney Roberts: Yeah. There are a few different tests when it comes to the GI system. So what I like to tell patients, and how I like to explain to patients when I'm ordering functional labs, because this is all brand new to most people, is that I need to assess the terrain and the triggers. So, the triggers are foods. Foods are definitely a huge one. So you can do food allergy, food sensitivity testing, or you can use an elimination and reintroduction food diet. I'm looking at environmental toxins that might be contributing, mental-emotional stress, which is just huge, I mean, everybody's dealing with that. And then when it comes to the terrain, let's say I need to get a sense of what would it look like if I was in your GI tract, what would I see? How is it functioning? What's happening in there? So I need to see the gut mucosa. Is it functioning properly? Is it letting the things in that needed to be let in and keeping the things out that need to stay out? Your digestive enzyme and stomach acid production, how's that looking? Digestion, absorption capabilities. And then of course the microbiome. So I need to see how are the commensal organisms of beneficial bacteria, how do those look? And then is there like an overgrowth of the pathogenic bacteria or fungi, whatever it might be? So a comprehensive stool analysis when it comes to assessing the terrain is really the best, the best thing. It gives you a wonderful picture of the terrain of the gut by assessing the stool itself. 
Rebekah Kelley: Wow. So then that kind of gets us into the next, which is really kind of, I think, the base for this, right? What is the benefit of creating a custom herbal formula for patients? So how does that tie into this? 
Courtney Roberts: Yeah, so herbal medicine. I just really love plants in themselves. And the reason is because plants contain hundreds of medicinal compounds. And not only are these compounds for the plants themselves, to protect them from different things that occur in the environment, but they are specifically tuned to our bodies' needs and the human body's physiology. Which just like, blows my mind every time I think about it, cause that's just so incredible. So they have an amazing ability to support the human body's innate defense and healing mechanisms. And this is really unlike most conventional drugs – not all of them – which block certain pathways. And this is a totally necessary step in certain instances, you definitely need a blocked pathway sometimes, but it is not suitable for every condition. And what I like about herbal medicine is that you can use it in instances when maybe pharmaceutical medicines aren't quite indicated yet. Or you can use them as an alternative in instances where pharmaceutical medicines would otherwise be indicated, but as long as you're doing it under the guide of a trained practitioner, that's important. 
Rebekah Kelley: Right. So I understand that you're actually offering a special GI health lab package through Village Green Apothecary, and can you provide us with a brief overview of what this includes, and also how people could access it or order it? 
Courtney Roberts: So with the new GI package, patients can directly order this kit through Village Green's website, and that's going to be on MyVillageGreen.com, and then you'll look under lab tests. And once you order that, that kit will be sent to the patient's home, the patient will collect the stool sample themselves, and then that stool will be shipped back to the lab. In the meantime, there is a questionnaire that gives me a little bit more information about diet and lifestyle, we talk about your medical history... and so I'm using all of that information with the results of the stool test to create a custom herbal formula. And then we can just see exactly what the patient needs and create the best, most results-driven formula from there. 
Rebekah Kelley: And do you have anything that you would say, that certain people are a good candidate? Like if they have X, Y or Z, like maybe a lot of gas maybe or... is there a certain thing that would then flag to someone, hey, I really want to reach out and talk to Dr. Courtney Roberts about this and go ahead and have a GI health lab pulled? 
Courtney Roberts: Yeah. So they often, like you said, gas is a big one. Bloating, sometimes just uncomfortable bloating or painful bloating in combination with stools. Stool changes, like maybe constipation or maybe sometimes they're a little bit loose. And then definitely other symptoms will often show up, like dysbiosis, overgrowth of certain bacteria. So you might have joint pain, also you may get headaches sometimes. You might feel a little depressed or down, you have some mood swings. So, those are often symptoms that I see that point me in the direction of saying, hey, you need to get a stool test. 
Rebekah Kelley: Right. Or maybe just wanting to optimize your health, right? And understanding, hey, how am I doing? I'd like to just kind of get a read and maybe... I mean, would you recommend it for people like that too, who are just wanting to have options?
Courtney Roberts: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. 
Rebekah Kelley: Awesome. Thanks Dr. Roberts. These are really valuable insights. Dr. Roberts can be found at MyVillageGreen.com and you can look actually under practitioners, right? Am I right Dr. Roberts? 
Courtney Roberts: Yes, that’s correct.

Rebekah Kelley: Welcome to the Humanized podcast, all about personalizing your health. I'm your host, Rebekah Kelley. And today I'm so excited to have Brendan Vermeire here. Today's subject is OAT – organic acid testing. And I can't wait to hear more about this. But before I introduce Brendan, I want to remind everyone to subscribe, to get all of our variety of casts and audio, video and transcription at HumanizedHealth.com. And I'd also like to thank our lead sponsor Village Green Apothecary, at MyVillageGreen.com. 
Before we get started and talk to Brendan, we also want to find out a little bit more about him. He's a functional medicine consultant, clinical researcher, board certified holistic health practitioner, master nutrition coach – long list, I'm going to keep on going – master personal trainer, USAW Sports Performance Coach, and CrossFit Certified Trainer. Lots of education there. Brendan is regarded as one of the top leading experts in metabolic health and holistic education. He is a proud owner of the Metabolic Solutions Institute, dedicated to educating health professionals and clinicians with cutting edge strategies to best serve their clients and patients.
Thank you so much for being here, Brendan. 
Brendan Vermeire: Well, thank you for having me, Rebekah. I love getting to have these conversations and you know, it's a little bit cut off here [gesturing to words on the wall behind him], but it says the greatest medicine of all is teaching people not to need it. And I, I really live by that because I really believe that we have to educate and empower our clients, our patients, our friends, our family, the world, to really evoke more of a self-healing movement, where people are empowered to advocate for themselves and transcend their greatest health struggles. So I think this is where a lot of the magic and healing happens, and I really appreciate the opportunity. 
Rebekah Kelley: So excited. Thank you so much. Well, most people have never heard of the organic acid test, or OAT test. So I just want to launch right into it. What can it tell us that typical medicine tests don't?
Brendan Vermeire: Absolutely. So lab testing is a subject near and dear to my heart. I really have built my whole career around lab testing. It started back when I was a personal trainer and nutritionist, where at that point in my career, I was primarily working with clients that were suffering from a lot of what I call the ""Standard American Metabolism,"" so good old uncle SAM. And that really is composed of a lot of the typical metabolic dysfunction, such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease – usually like a subclinical hypothyroid, kind of a sluggish thyroid – HPA axis, dysfunction, leaky gut, a dysbiotic microbiome. The list goes on and on and on, and it is a very standard American metabolic sort of milieu, this chronic metabolic dysfunction that creates this low grade meta inflammation that people are kind of quite literally cooking in their bodies long-term, and that's really where we see the rise of all of these chronic conditions and co-morbidities.
And so with lab testing, a lot of the clients I was working with at the time, early in my career, [I would ask] what's your goal, why are you here? Well, I want to lose weight. Okay – do you also want to feel better? Well, sure, I think I'll feel better when I lose weight. Okay, cool. And you dig for their ""why"" and, well, how do YOU want to measure progress along this journey? Well, you know, the scale, I want to lose 30 pounds in the next 3 to 6 months. 
So you have to reverse engineer that. And this is where, even as a young and new professional, I knew the toxic psychology that that scale, and just pure body weight really induces. And it can very quickly dismantle all the behavior modification that the client is so tenaciously trying to integrate into their life. And so from day one, I was like, no, we're not using the scale to measure progress. We're going to measure your body fat using a $10,000 body fat scanner. We're going to use VO2 testing to measure your respiratory quotient, your gas exchange for cardiac output and basal metabolic rate. And we're going to use lab testing. 
And so it really started with good old-fashioned blood work, blood chemistry, no different than you might go do through your conventional health care provider for just general health monitoring. So it was during that time, I started getting exposed to some of these other, more kind of exotic lab tests, whether it was a salivary cortisol DHA profile, food sensitivity testing... and that launched me into this whole world of functional lab testing, which I dove head first in. I climbed to the top of that industry. I've trained hundreds, and many, many practitioners, doctors – and with functional lab testing, it's an exploding market. There's a test for everything. 
Now, I think it's really important, before we get into organic acids, to understand that a lot of these functional lab tests, they really don't have a lot of clinical significance established behind it. A lot of them are experimental tests. A lot of them don't actually have established efficacy. And of course, you know, if these tests were really that great or that clinically effective, why are they not being used in mainstream conventional health care? Is it that it's the best new thing and it just hasn't integrated or gotten adopted into conventional healthcare? Or is it because, hey, it doesn't have clinical significance, so why would we use it as a clinical tool? 
So I say that to sort of illustrate why I love organic acids so much, because out of all the functional tests, I think it really stands out, as it has probably the most science behind it. Out of everything outside of blood testing, it has much more established science, clinical significance, and it can really elucidate some of these underlying metabolic, hidden stressors that can contribute to the metabolic dysfunction that we experience as our symptoms, our health complaints, and maybe even different diagnostic labels that we've been given and diagnosed with. 
So with organic acid testing, it originally was a technology used in conventional health care. And the original purpose was to detect for, basically, inborn errors and these genetic mutations that could cause severe life-shortening diseases in young people, such as maple syrup urine disease. It's kind of one of the main ones, and it has a funny name, but it's actually a very horrible genetic disease that causes mortality, usually before the age of 3. So that was the original purpose. But once we started realizing, well, hey we can measure these organic acids, these metabolic metabolites in the urine, and, what else can we measure? So that original technology has been expanded upon by a lot of different scientists around the world. And this has given rise to these ""functional"" organic acid profiles that are more elaborate, more sensitive and looking at other metabolic characteristics that reflect a dysfunctional biochemistry and dysfunctional metabolic systems. 
So depending on... there are multiple organic acid tests on the market, multiple laboratories have their own unique tests. So the markers are slightly different from panel to panel, but they do have more in common than anything. And the way that I describe the organic acid test is typically as a microbial burden and a toxicity load type of assay. So where your conventional blood chemistry is more an accurate reflection of your physiology, how are your organs working, how is your glucose regulation, what are your lipids doing – to make sure that there's no tissues, no organs that are dysfunctional – organic acid testing is a very sensitive way that we can look at things such as bacterial or fungal overgrowth within the GI tract, which is actually a really hard thing to test for. These days there's a huge sort of obsession with stool testing and using this experimental PCR technology, which really hasn't been strongly validated yet. But a lot of these different bacterial or fungal pathogens, potentially, or commensal microbes that live in our microbiome, well, they produce and release a lot of these metabolites, that then we can measure the quantity of those metabolites in the urine. And so this actually gives us a lot of insight into does this client or patient have some sort of, basically, ""microbe or bug"" overgrowth that might be contributing to their health dysfunction. 
So that's probably one of the most valuable aspects of the organic acid test, but there are a lot of things that we can measure in the urine and we really can't get that information elsewhere, such as our neuro-transmitters. So when it comes to our brain hormones and brain chemicals, those neurotransmitters… you can't measure what's going on in the central nervous system. The best thing that we have is looking at the breakdown products of these neurotransmitters that we can measure in the urine through organic acid testing. So we look at actually mitochondrial function, detox capacity, glycolytic capabilities of how we're regulating and converting blood sugar, ketone and fatty acid oxidation – so how well can this person utilize fat as a fuel source – as well as different types of genetic markers and other more lucrative things like oxalate metabolism.
So this is why, to more simplistically describe it, I really say microbial burden and toxic load. And when you look at a lot of the common characteristics of some of these different pathophysiologies, whether it's IBS and IBD, gastrointestinal issues, mental health disorders, depression, anxiety, neurodegeneration, or even in something like autoimmune or chronic fatigue or fibromyalgia, the OAT test really does identify some of those hidden root causes that we can't really effectively measure on anything else.
So it is a test that I've used abundantly in my practice. I've created courses around it and train doctors around the country and the world on how to implement the organic acid test into their practice. And so where I really recommend people consider it is any type of gut-brain access disorder. So anybody that has GI issues, whether that's mild IBS or just bloating or diarrhea, constipation, so on and so forth, in any sort of mental health – so gut issues, mental health issues, chronic pain, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, autoimmunity. If somebody resonates with those demographics, I absolutely recommend running organic acids test. It's an inexpensive, at-home, non-invasive urine test that could potentially ""identify"" some root cause contributing factors that, when addressed effectively, could very much change the life of that individual and change the course of their health and their disease states and their diagnostic labels, and really empower them to overcome that and re-achieve vital vibrant health again. So I think it's a very valuable assay. 
Rebekah Kelley: Wow, Brendan, that's pretty amazing. Could certainly argue for adding that to our list of things for whenever we get reviewed for our health. Thanks Brendan, those are really valuable insights. Brendan Vermeire can be found at www.MetabolicSolutionsLLC.com.

He is a proud owner of the Metabolic Solutions Institute, dedicated to educating health professionals and clinicians with cutting edge strategies to best serve their clients and patients. 
Brendan, thank you so much for being with us. 
Brendan Vermeire: Thanks for having me, Rebekah I love having these conversations to educate and empower people so they can take back their health. And I really think that's never been more needed than it is today, so it's really a privilege to be here. 
Rebekah Kelley: I'm going to jump right in. When we hear the term inflammation, of course, most of us think of joint pain, right? But please explain what you mean by neuroinflammation.
Brendan Vermeire: Absolutely. So I think inflammation is a very, very misunderstood topic. The word gets thrown around a lot. And in reality, inflammation is an extremely complex immunological mechanism that the body uses to heal itself, period. The analogy I always like to use is that inflammation is a mechanism that the immune system uses, and we can think of it as kind of a prescribed fire, a controlled fire that the body uses to fight off infections and pathogens, different types of offensive antigens and toxins, as well as help to remodel tissues. We have to clear out some old, damaged cells so that new ones can take root and grow. So it's really no different than, let's say, some farmers, that they do a controlled, prescribed burn of the field to burn down the waste, so that way it recycles the nutrients back into the soil, so then new life can grow through.
So that, under normal physiological circumstances, is really what inflammation is. It's a mechanism by which the body heals so that new life, new cells, can take its place. So when under normal circumstances, it's acute, it's controlled, it will ramp up as needed to fight something off and clean up the tissues, and then it will self-resolve on its own.
But today, in today's modern world, the toxic environment, the very stressful lifestyle that we all live, the excess of pro-inflammatory diet and lifestyle choices, our bodies, our cells, our immune system is getting overwhelmed and bombarded by so many pro-inflammatory input signals.
It gets really confusing when you try to dissect stress and bugs and microbes, infections and food sensitivities and toxins, and what's good nutrition or bad – but if we just think about this as, they're just input signals that your cells and your DNA, your genes are listening to.
So the question is, how many anti-inflammatory input signals is your body getting versus how many pro-inflammatory? And if that's balanced, we're in health, we're in homeostasis, we feel good, we're thriving. But the reality is, with the modern lifestyle, the standard American diet, the standard American lifestyle, the toxic environment, the high-speed stressful life that we all live – these are all pro-inflammatory input signals that are ramping up this chronic meta-inflammation. And part of the problem is, you go to your doctor, you do a basic, basic, minimal (so they can keep their expenses low) blood chemistry. You don't have any pronounced acute inflammation that would really justify any pharmaceutical or medical intervention.
And so this is where the chronic disease pandemic, the mental health crisis... it's really due to this underlying [inflammation]... it's a lower grade, but chronic. You think about the difference between a fire in your kitchen versus a slow cooker. And everybody, their bodies, their brains, included – it's like a slow cooking effect. And this might present down the road as cardiovascular disease, autoimmunity, depression, neurodegeneration. The list goes on and on and on. We see all of these chronic conditions are often comorbidities of one another. And the underlying theme is that chronic inflammation. 
And the thing is you have different types of inflammation in different tissues of the body. So neuroinflammation is referring to excess inflammation of the neurons of the central nervous system of your brain cells. And the previous theory of mental illness was what we called the mono immune theory of mental illness, which is basically referring to... well, mental illness is due to imbalanced brain chemicals. So the pharmaceutical focus has always been on how do we balance and modulate the activity of all these neurotransmitters, like serotonin, GABA, norepinephrine, dopamine, so on and so forth. 
But what we now know through more modern and up-to-date research is actually those neurotransmitter imbalances are downstream from upstream inflammation and oxidative stress. And so what we now understand is all these pro-inflammatory input signals, through our psychology, our lifestyle, our environment – this is really driving t his chronic inflammation of the brain that then causes the breakdown of your brain cells, the degeneration long-term, the brain chemical imbalances. And so now, you know, sometimes I get trolled. People think I make this up. But big pharma has already put about a billion dollars into creating a new drug and its mechanism of action is by blocking pro-inflammatory cytokines. Now, the problem with these drugs is they're immunosuppressive. They are blocking the immune system's ability to communicate with the body. So yes, it might reduce the symptoms of neuroinflammation – like depression, anxiety and mental illness – but it's coming at the cost of reducing your immunity. So the problem that they're going to run into is how do you release an immunosuppressive drug for a mental health crisis during an infectious disease crisis? And that's what's happening.
So the reality is we have to take all of this information to empower ourselves on how can I naturally and holistically reduce my inflammatory load and inflammatory burden through my psychology, through my environment, through my lifestyle, through my diet, through my supplementation, and using medications responsibly, as needed, on top of that. So it's a really complex issue and something I'm horribly passionate about because this is not common knowledge, unfortunately, even though all the science is at our fingertips all day, every day. 
Rebekah Kelley: Wow. That's really amazing. Thanks, Brendan. Those are really valuable insights. Brendan Vermeire can be found at www.MetabolicSolutionsLLC.com.

Now a little bit about Brendan. He's a functional medicine consultant, clinical researcher, board certified holistic health practitioner, master nutrition coach, master personal trainer, USAW Sports Performance Coach, and CrossFit Certified Trainer. Brendan is regarded as one of the top leading experts in metabolic health and holistic education. He is the proud owner of the Metabolic Solutions Institute, dedicated to educating health professionals and clinicians with cutting edge strategies to best serve their clients and patients. 
So excited to talk about it. So, Brendan, what are microglial cells? 
Brendan Vermeire: Yeah. Well, thanks for that flattering bio. I never get used to hearing it read back to me and everything. And it's like, oh, I guess I have done a lot. 
Rebekah Kelley: You have, yes you have. 
Brendan Vermeire: And so it's been interesting to, having started as a personal trainer and nutritionist to then be here where most of my life now centers around clinical research, specifically around the subject of microglial activation, which is so specific and so kind of niche down. But it's been a beautiful journey to get here in a very kind of organic evolution as my interests and curiosities have developed. 
So with microglial cells, getting right into it, microglia are the innate immune cells of the central nervous system, so thinking about white blood cells of the immune system that are there to protect us and remodel tissues and clean up debris and all of the amazing things that we love the immune system for.
And so in the central nervous system, we have all different types of glial cells. We have astrocytes and microglia and macroglia, and all these different things. And microglia, I really describe them as the guardians and the architects of the central nervous system. They are exclusive to the central nervous system. So brain, spinal cord, on the other side, the blood-brain barrier, they are exclusive to that part of the body. And researchers, scientists, they used to think that the microglial cells were actually macrophages from the periphery that had migrated into the parenchyma and the tissue of the central nervous system, but then they figured out, actually, these are two different cell types with two different cell lineages, but they were very, very, very similar. 
So all of the audience that might be familiar with monocytes and macrophages, these are basically the monocytes, the macrophage of the central nervous system. So that's where I think the architect and guardian is a perfect analogy because these microglial cells, their job is, they are the first line of defense in the brain. So if we have any sort of pathogen or inflammatory insult or damage like a concussion or something, they are the first line of defense to use inflammation as the ""cleansing fire"" to burn off the debris or fight off the pathogen, or whatever it is. But also they're the architects in the sense that they co-regulate neuroplasticity and neurogenesis, which is really just fancy words for saying the remodeling of the neural connections of the brain. So we have tons and tons of these neurons, and we're constantly producing new neurons, new brain cells, which is antagonistic to the previous belief, which was [that] you're born with so many brain cells, you don't get more. 
Rebekah Kelley: Yeah, don't burn them out, they would say. Don't burn them out. 
Brendan Vermeire: Exactly. They used to think that our neural networks were very stagnant and non-malleable. And so that's where, with neurodegeneration, which has become the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, now researchers are starting to think about Alzheimer's as like a type three diabetes. There's a lot to unpack there, but the neurodegeneration aspect has really driven, like, we need to figure out why does the brain degenerate? And really it comes down to these microglial cells and their activation. 
So there's a lot to unpack with what drives microglial activation and what causes a dysfunction. Because under normal, healthy, physiological circumstances, these microglial cells appropriately fight off the foreign invader, repair the damage and regenerate the brain.
So if we're dealing with a crisis of neurodegeneration and mental illness, these cells have become the focal point of psychiatric research and neurodegenerative research. And this is where I've really kind of dedicated my whole career, to unraveling these things. Because big pharma, they're already working on some fancy drugs that are targeting different proteins and receptors on the microglia. So they recognize, if we can create drugs to modulate the activity of these cells, we're going to create the next billion dollar drug. So as consumers, patients, clients, practitioners, professionals, we need to catch up on that science so that we can functionally use the same science and holistically, naturally use that to repair our own brain, so that way we don't become excessively reliant on the next pharmaceutical drugs. 
Rebekah Kelley: Right. That's a beautiful description. I love how you explain what a microglial cell is because I've heard it, but I don't fully understand it. So considering how you just described it, what does microglial dysfunction look like? What are those symptoms? I mean, you've named a few things, but what does that look like? An activation syndrome? What does that look like? 
Brendan Vermeire: So, some of these pseudo-diagnosis things that we talk about in the functional medicine space, I think they could be helpful or hurtful depending on how we communicate them. Right? So, leaky gut, leaky brain, mitochondrial dysfunction, and mass cell activation syndrome has gotten really, really popular. So I will admit – I'm not a hypocrite – I was inspired by the mass cell activation thing. I was like, well, if we're going to get all hot and bothered and crazy about mass cell activation, I think microglial activation is just as important, if not more important.
Now ultimately, it's just a phrase, but I think understanding what that is and understanding the role of microglial cells in mental illness and neurodegeneration. So I hope people use my terminology appropriately because we do have to keep in mind, immune cells, by evolution, by nature, they are designed to be activated. That's the whole point, right? So we could easily say there's a platelet activation, an eosinophil activation syndrome, but with that sort of disclaimer and retort expressed, microglial dysregulation is really what leads to mental illness and neurodegeneration. Like, all across the board. I mean, we're talking autism dysfunction and just lower functioning autism, schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, PTSD, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS, multiple sclerosis – like literally every single neurological illness can very much be linked back to microglial dysregulation. 
So this is where I've created courses and stuff around this for providers. And understanding this core concept of, under normal, healthy physiological circumstances, these microglial cells are inactivated. Which actually, I think that's misleading. They're quiescent, which is not the same thing as inactive. They're just patrolling the environment. So if you think about a police officer that's just doing his rounds around the city, making sure everything's calm and under control, he's just chilling and cruising. So that's quiescent, which is usually said ""inactivated,"" but they're patrolling. But then what happens when the police officer gets, you know, radio signals, like there's a bad guy that you got to go arrest or shoot or whatever, he's going to turn his sirens on, stomp on the gas pedal, and he's going in full-blown GI Joe mode.
So that's going to happen with these microglial cells when they detect some sort of danger or threat. That could be some sort of pathogen or an antigen or inflammatory insult or toxin or whatever it is, but they need to become activated into... They have two primary phenotypes. So you've got these quiescent microglial cells. And then when they're becoming activated, they're either going to morph through what's called microgliosis, just the morphology as they change their form, they actually get kind of big and bulky and puffy, whereas under their normal quiescent, they're kind of like an octopus, they're kind of small with these long arms, but they beef up a lot when they go GI Joe mode. And in the M1 phenotype, this is your cytotoxic, pro-inflammatory, neuro-destructive GI Joe, ready to kick down doors and shoot bad guys – that's what that one is. But then you have this M2 phenotype, which looks structurally very similar, but this is neuroprotective, neuro-regenerative, anti-inflammatory. 
And so ultimately, what we actually have seen through the literature through measuring different surface protein markers that you can only do in clinical research, Petri dish kind of technology... but they've seen that it's not really one or the other. It's not like these cells, they turn into M1 neuro-destructive, versus M2 neurogenerative. They can actually be a little bit of both. They're highly dynamic so they can actually be shooting and spitting out pro-inflammatory cytokines, but they can also be releasing neurotrophic factors and anti-inflammatory cytokines at the same time.
But this is why I call them the guardians and the architects, because it's kind of like a firefighter, GI Joe, policeman, all in one. They're not a one trick pony. And so basically it's more of a spectrum of activation. And they can be doing different things in different brain regions, right? Just because you have a lot of M1 phenotype in your hypothalamus doesn't mean that your frontal lobe is pro-inflammatory. There's something else going on over there. 
There's millions of these microglial cells in the brain. They make up about 10% of the cell population in the brain. So they're greatly outnumbered by other brain cell types, which is why they're so critical. They're kind of like the Marines or the special forces. Really though, we have to be looking at the net effect of how much is the scale tipped towards the M1 neurodegenerative, pro-inflammatory phenotype. And that's what most Americans, like literally the whole American population, is dealing with because of the standard American diet, lifestyle, toxic environment, so on and so forth. Our brains are quite literally, and our microglial cells are quite literally overwhelmed with all of these pro-inflammatory input signals. This is what leads to neurodegeneration, is then there's too much nerve destruction, too many pro-inflammatory insults, and what we need is to tip the scales back to homeostasis, where there's a balance of M1 and M2. So most people with the standard American brain, standard American mind, they're heavily skewed towards that M1 phenotype. 
Rebekah Kelley: I love how you also... you know, I love Marvel comics. So give me this visual of these fighters coming in to deal with, as it relates to what the body needs.
So, can you then explain how microglial dysfunction and, I mean, you've touched on it, but how does that relate to mental illness and mental health? I guess mental wellness maybe is a better way of saying it, but how does that connect? 
Brendan Vermeire: Sure. I mean, certainly mental health can be multifaceted. Is it more psychological, emotional, kind of stress driven, or is it more of a physiological dysfunction that's then causing symptoms of mental illness? So it can be very ambiguous and multifaceted. 
But in regard to mental illness, the classic narrative is mental illness is driven by these neurotransmitter brain chemical imbalances, which is based on a theory that's like 40 years old. And we have decades of new research that lucidates, well, yes, neurotransmitter imbalances are part of what's going on there. But we now really see that inflammation is upstream from that. So there's actually two key pathways, both of which are biochemical pathways expressed in microglial cells, where under the presence of heightened inflammation, oxidative stress, it totally disregulates our neurotransmitters because these key pathways, these key GTPCH1 and IDO1, and these two key enzymes that actually go to contribute to producing serotonin and dopamine and GABA and glutamate and all of our kind of primary neurotransmitters, those get totally dysregulated when these microglial cells are activated into their pro-inflammatory state. So in a lot of ways, with mental illness, if we remove the pro-inflammatory insult, if we can restore balance to these microglial cells, the neurotransmitters will kind of fix themselves. But most of our therapeutics and drugs and psychiatric care and model is based on working on the downstream neurotransmitter imbalances, and they're not really doing anything about the upstream microglial dysregulation.

Rebekah Kelley: Welcome to the Humanized podcast, all about personalizing your health. I am your host, Rebekah Kelley, and today we'll be discussing Personalizing Health Through an Understanding of Genetics, with Dr. Chrissie Williamson. Before I introduce Dr. Williamson, I want to remind everyone to subscribe, to get all of our variety of casts in audio, video and transcription at HumanizedHealth.com. I'd also like to thank our lead sponsor, Village Green Apothecary, at MyVillageGreen.com. 
A little bit about Dr. Chrissie Williamson. She is a master of the biomechanical and nutritional sciences. As the owner and founder of Nutritional Genomics Institute, she has dedicated her life's work to revolutionizing personalized medical nutrition. Chrissie's systems medicine approach encompasses both cutting edge genomic technology and functional testing, offering the highest level of metabolic evolution evaluation, and lights a path for lifelong healing and wellness. Those are a lot of college words together. [Laughs] Thank you for being here, Dr. Chrissie. A lot of college also, to get all that, right?
Chrissie Williamson: Yes, a lot of college. [Laughs]
Rebekah Kelley: So glad to have you. Thank you. 
Chrissie Williamson: Yeah, excited to be here. Thanks for having me. 
Rebekah Kelley: So I just want to ask you right away. Is there a strong connection between genetics and health? 
Chrissie Williamson: Of course there is. That's why we have the Nutritional Genomics Institute. So I get this question all the time about what is the connection, and people are often shocked because I tell them that only about 10 to 40% of their health is based on genetics. I think that's a little bit of a shocker. And then they go, well, gosh, Dr. C., where's the rest of it? And I tell them that the next 40% is basically lifestyle. And so we're talking about, gosh, well, do you live next to a farm? Are you exposed to pesticides? Do you eat organically? How well do you sleep? You're under stress? You know, so stress is here, it's totally fine. So those kinds of things. And so then they go, oh gosh, that's 40% and another 40%, or 80%... where's the other 20%? And that's what we kind of call our ""special sauce"" at NGI. And that's something called epigenetics or epigenetic expression.
And the way that we measure that is something called metabolomics. And so when we're looking at that, those are special little biomarkers that help us measure gene expression. And that's something that's pretty new, pretty fancy, pretty special that we look at. And then these interesting little algorithms that we build, where we look at one genetic variation, or one SNP or single nucleotide polymorphism, which is basically a little spelling error in your genetic makeup or your blueprint, and all of these things have little co-factors or little nutrients that make them go. Okay. And if you don't have the right thing to make it go – pass go, collect $200 kind of thing – if it doesn't work well, then you're not going to make the product that it's supposed to make. 
So when we look at these things, we look at what's upstream from that SNP, and also what's downstream. And we're measuring all the little chemical soup around it. So when we figure out how all of that is dancing together, that's how we're actually measuring genetic expression. So it's a pretty big deal to be able to measure genetic expression. We haven't really been able to do that until recently.
Rebekah Kelley: Wow. So the percentages together, right? That adds up. So that means you actually have some control, is what you're saying. It's not just based upon your genetics, but your genetics can show your trends, right? And where you might have some potential challenges. So what is the interrelationship between genetics and the microbiome?
Chrissie Williamson: That's also a really big question. I've written a couple of papers on that topic, actually. So, without making that one too complicated, bacterium have these little sticky coats on the outside of them. They're called liposaccharides . And bacteria themselves actually can secrete little chemicals, little chemical messengers, they're called interleukins. And they can also secrete neurotransmitters. So, that can be problematic in itself. And so our immune system, of course, is coded by our genes, to begin with, and they create these interleukins or these little chemical messengers, and they also control naturally how many neurotransmitters you're going to have. And so if all of a sudden you have these extra bacteria, or not enough bacteria, that are making these extra chemicals in your body, your immune system's like, hold the phone, wait a minute. Like you were supposed to have this perfect balance of what's going on in here and then you're all of a sudden spewing out all this extra stuff. Your immune system might get a little overreactive, might get a little cranky about that, and maybe give you a disease or two, or just make you feel bad if you're not having a good day. 
So this is why we have a plethora of studies that show the relationship between the microbiome and diseases like autism and cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, the list goes on and on and on. It's also why we use certain probiotics to alter the microbiome and disease states, which is pretty remarkable that we've been able to do that. 
Rebekah Kelley: Wow. So to what degree then can diet and lifestyle influence our genetic expression?
Chrissie Williamson: Pretty vastly. So, if we kind of go back to those numbers that I quoted you, if we go to the lower end of that 10 to 40%, having 10 to 40% of your health be influenced by genetics – if we go down to 10%, that means that 90% of your health could actually be influenced by your lifestyle and diet. So, your genes may not actually be your destiny, but your gene expression certainly is your destiny. And the way that we measure that is through this omics technology. So it's really the measurement of that and the control and the tweaking of that, is really where the magic happens. So, it really should influence your choices and give you a lot of empowerment – which is what we're really trying to do in this next phase of personalized medicine, is not only empower patients, but also empower their physicians so that they can make better choices.
Rebekah Kelley: Can you give an example of, if someone found something out, like what they could do diet- and lifestyle-wise that would maybe affect that?  
Chrissie Williamson: Sure. So let's talk about, since we talked about neurotransmitters... so, let's see here. So there's an enzyme, it's called glutamic acid decarboxylase or, GAD. And so this enzyme lives in the brain and it lives in the pancreas, and traditionally it's been associated with type one diabetes. But it runs on a special form of vitamin B6 called P5P. And if you have a SNP, or an impairment in this gene, then you're going to not only have panic attacks, but you're also going to have what we call type one and a half diabetes. So your insulin levels are going to be really low, which is going to be odd for diabetes, or type two diabetes, but your sugar levels are going to be really high. So it's an odd presentation, but the way that we fix this, is we give you about 150 milligrams of P5P. But you wouldn't know that by running a blood test, you'd have to run an organic acids test and look at something called xanthurenate to be able to see that. And of course you can also look at microbiome testing. Bifidobacteria produces GABA, the end product of this conversion takes glutamate and converts it into GABA, so you're going to have naturally low levels of GABA if you have this, which is what causes you to have the panic attacks. So you could also give them additional bifidobacteria in terms of a probiotic, as well. 
So there are lots of different things that we can do to not only look at genetics, but also measure the different things that are in the ecosystem, so in your omics technology. Look at those things in the metabolomics.
Rebekah Kelley: Wow. And that's something that most people aren't going to find whenever they're traditionally going in, having their doctor do their test, or 23andMe, right? This is going to be a whole other level of depth and understanding. 
Chrissie Williamson: So, you may find the gene variation on 23andMe, but it's not going to give you... you're not going to know whether it's active or not. So the key thing here… and you may have the genetic variation, but you may not know the symptoms that are associated with actually having an active SNP. And you certainly wouldn't want to treat it if it wasn't an active SNP, as too much P5P can actually be dangerous, as well.

Rebekah Kelley: Welcome to the Humanized podcast, all about personalizing your health. I am your host, Rebekah Kelley. And today we'll be discussing Going Beyond Traditional Medical Testing Using Nutritional Genomics, with Dr. Chrissie Williamson. Before I introduce Dr. Williamson, I want to remind everyone to subscribe to get all of our variety of casts in audio, video and transcription at HumanizedHealth.com.

Chrissie's systems medicine approach encompasses both cutting edge genomic technology and functional testing, offering the highest level of metabolic evolution, and lights a path for lifelong healing and wellness. Thank you for being here, Dr. Chrissie. 
Chrissie Williamson: Thanks for having me. 
Rebekah Kelley: So I want to just know, is the information from traditional medical testing sufficient for our good health?
Chrissie Williamson: Well, I think that's depending on what kind of condition you're trying to treat. If you are dying, then traditional medical testing is sufficient. And that's really what it's designed to do. If you go in and you have a heart attack, if you've broken your leg, if your appendix is rupturing, then traditional medical testing is quite effective and actually brilliant. We have amazing technology for all of the things that we need to do. We have Da Vinci [robotic surgery] technology, we have amazing, amazing medical technology. 
But if we're looking at preventative medicine, then the lab ranges that we have when we're looking at the emergency care, are awful. You know, we really need a much tighter range to actually see the variations and, gosh, we're trending towards getting sick. And so that's why we have functional testing, where we look at things like metabolomics or some of our new omics technologies, which are pretty amazing. 
And so, to answer your question, it depends on what you're looking at. You know, again, we have some amazing technology in terms of the medical world, but when we're looking at trying to prevent disease, there can be some other tests that we need to look at. 
Rebekah Kelley: So, what are some of the benefits and limitations of... I'm sorry, can you explain the kind of testing you use in your approach? Because I know for me, I'm not as familiar with it because, of course I'm more familiar with going in to the doctor and you get your traditional tests, but what would you be doing? If I came to see you, what would that be like? What would that experience be like? 
Chrissie Williamson: Sure. So, we do use some traditional testing, but then we also use more specialized testing, as well. So, if we were to look at a cardiovascular panel, most doctors are going to run a basic lipid panel. So, cholesterol, your good cholesterol, your bad cholesterol, your triglycerides, that sort of thing. In addition to that, we would run a fractionated particle test. We're going to look at whether your good cholesterol is fat and fluffy, whether or not your bad cholesterol is hard and dense, and then we're going to run a bunch of inflammatory markers. We're going to be looking at a whole bunch of different things that go along with your type of condition. 
And then we're going to be looking at something called metabolomics. And so these are these little biomarkers that help us determine whether or not your genes are expressing themselves. So of course at NGI, the Nutritional Genomics Institute, we're looking at your genome. But you know, it's important to understand that your genes, just because you have a genetic variation, doesn't mean that it's expressed. So we have created multi-system algorithms to determine whether or not your genes are expressing themselves, and have figured out whether or not, basically on these different biomarkers, whether or not a certain genetic defect or mutation or SNP – a single nucleotide polymorphism – is actually impaired. So we use specialized omics technology to be able to determine whether or not that gene is actually expressing itself. So we use everything from organic acids, amino acids, fatty acid testing, that sort of thing, stool testing, which is always fun – people are, like, where do I sign up for that? But you know, we use basically everything under the sun, in congruence with traditional medical testing, as well. 
Rebekah Kelley: Now, is that the same as 23andMe then, whenever you're doing the genetic testing? 
Chrissie Williamson: So I want to stress that 23andMe and other direct-to-consumer testing – that should really be used as a screening test. So, we do use direct-to-consumer testing at the Institute, but we use it for things that are non-diagnosable. So if you were looking at what kind of diet you should eat, should you be on a low oxalate diet? Should you be avoiding high histamine foods? What's your optimal sport performance, or that sort of thing… 23andMe and other direct-to-consumer testing, those types of things are absolutely fine. But let's just say that we run a diet panel and we find a SNP for celiac disease. We would not want to diagnose you based on that particular test. We would want to do something called molecular genetic testing. So that would be through Labcorp. You'd want to want to run that through your doctor's office. 
So it's important to make sure that you understand the distinction between some of these SNP testing, and then actual molecular genetic testing. So it's important to make sure that, unless they're FDA cleared – which some of the 23andMe testing sessions are, which can be a little confusing – but a lot of the tests are not actually CLIA certified [Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments], which would in plain English, that's a government way to certify the safety of the lab or how efficient it is. But let's just say on one day you give a sample and you run the test. If you were to do it a week later, you might not get the same results. So, you know, this is something that you want to make sure that you're not basing any lifelong decisions on this particular topic. 
Rebekah Kelley: Gotcha. So can you give us some examples of how genetic testing can help someone personalize one's health recommendations? That would be, maybe enhancing traditional, right? Cause it sounds to me like in a way you're offering something that's, like, optimizing, right? You're getting right into what we need to do to really be preventative, proactive, get ahead of something. 
Chrissie Williamson: Of course. All right. So I always like to talk about myself. I’m always talking about these things. So, everybody's struggled with wanting to be on a diet at some point, or wanting to lose weight or something like that, and so I always joke – everybody always jokes at the practice – that if there's a weird gene or weird stuff, then Dr. Chrissie has it. And so I have this gene where basically, if I work out too much, then I get fat. Okay? So if I lift weights too much, then I get belly fat. Which...
Rebekah Kelley: That is cruel. That is cruel.
Chrissie Williamson: Isn't this wrong? This is so wrong. I basically, after I had my kids, I was in the gym, trying to work out and like, why am I still... what is happening here? And so, I ended up developing, we did optimal diet first, and then we did our lean panel. And then we did our sport panel, which is our exercise panel. And then we did our weight loss panel. And so, one of the things that happened when we did our sport panel is that I found it I have this gene, basically, the more I lifted weights, then the more belly fat I got. I thought, man, this is crazy! Basically, I'm designed to walk forever, which is kind of cool. I don't have to go slave at the gym anymore. But this is one of those things, it's not a diagnosable condition, it's not anything like that, but it helps me... you know, it was wonderful, that I didn't have to go work out so much anymore. But I learned what type of diet and exercise was right for MY body. 
And so those are the types of things that you can learn by doing this type of genetic analysis. And there are all kinds of things that you can learn doing this type of thing. There are other things based on your cardiac risks, your insulin resistance risks, whether or not you have a risk for diseases, those types of things. At the Institute, we have it broken down based on disease type, or panel, is what we call them. The fun stuff is basically what your optimal sport is, we have a compatibility panel, a dating panel, which is also really fun and interesting for those single people out there – whether or not your new boyfriend or spouse might leave the drawers open, or something like that. And you're like, I can't handle it, I'm going to walk away. [Both laugh] So all this is basically genetics and neurotransmitters. There's all kinds of fun stuff that you can learn about, based on genes. So yeah, there's all kinds of fun things that you can learn. Then we do... we have a lot of fun over at NGI. 
Rebekah Kelley: Yes you do. [Both laugh] 
Chrissie Williamson: Yes, we do.

Rebekah Kelley: Welcome to the Humanized podcast, all about personalizing your health. I am your host, Rebekah Kelley, and today we'll be discussing Your Genes and Weight Management with Chrissie Williamson. But before I introduce Chrissie Williamson, I want to remind everyone to subscribe and get all the other variety of casts in audio, video and transcription at HumanizedHealth.com. I'd also like to thank our lead sponsor, Village Green Apothecary, at MyVillageGreen.com. 
So, Dr. Chrissie Williamson is a master of the biochemical and nutritional sciences. As the owner and founder of the Nutritional Genomics Institute, she has dedicated her life's work to revolutionizing personalized medical nutrition. Chrissie's systems medicine approach encompasses both cutting edge genomic technology and functional testing, offering the highest level of metabolic evaluation, and lights a path for lifelong healing and wellness. Dr. Chrissie, thanks for being with us.
Chrissie Williamson: Thanks for having me. Excited to be here. 
Rebekah Kelley: So, I am so excited to talk about this subject. And I know that this is very much within the context of what we are about at Humanized Health, personalizing your health care. And you actually do that, down to the snip [SNP, or single nucleotide polymorphism], right? So we're really getting into something that's really, really personalized. So can you explain how genes can impact metabolism and weight? 

Chrissie Williamson: So that's a question we get all the time, is how do your genes and your blueprint impact your metabolism and weight, and is a genetic? And gosh you know, everybody in my family's overweight, and this must impact me, so I'm just gonna sit on the couch and eat bonbons and chips and not worry about it cause it's in my genes and, I'm just, why bother? 
So, part of that is true and part of it isn't true. We inherit a lot of things from our parents, some good, some bad. One of the things that babies inherit from their parents is actually their microbiomes, especially if it's a vaginal birth. So, we do get our microbiome obviously that way. And then we also get it from living in the same environment as our brothers and sisters and our parents. So that's one thing that actually strongly influences our metabolism and our weight regulation. So the bacteroides and firmicutes ratio is something that's been studied quite a bit in terms of whether or not we are going to have a weight loss pattern or not.
Testing is important for that, as well. But we also pick up a lot of our parents' bad habits. So, if mom and dad happened to go and stress eat, then we may go and stress eat, too. Now, are there genes that are associated with stress eating? Of course there are. Are there genes that are associated maybe with dopamine deficiency that might cause us to maybe want to eat a little bit more from time to time? Of course there are. But then there's also cultural things, as well. 
So, to answer your question, can genes impact metabolism and weight? Sure. But I think your epigenes or epigenomics have a much larger impact on your metabolism and weight. So, your environment, how you're actually going to make those genes express themselves, have a bigger impact on your true weight, final weight anyway. So it's the environment loading the gun, or sort of the genes loading the gun and the environment pulling the trigger kind of thing. 
Rebekah Kelley: Right. Wow. Fascinating. So, what are some key snips that can influence an individual's response to their diet, like fats, protein carbs... are there some that influence body weight, appetite, blood sugar, diabetes risk, circadian rhythm, all of these kinds of things. Can you share more about that? 
Chrissie Williamson: Sure. Yeah. There are some that have been really well studied that really do impact whether or not you should or should not eat certain macronutrients or that really truly do impact your risk for certain diseases. There's a study that just recently came out just a couple of days ago that reinforced what we call the classic yang study of 2007, about saturated fats. Because of course we hear all the time, oh, saturated fat is good for us, and saturated fat is bad. We're not really sure whether we should eat eggs or not... you know, all these different things. And it suddenly came out... 
Rebekah Kelley: It's so confusing. There's so many messages and it's hard to know how to take care of yourself, and you hear this and you hear that. But you're saying it might depend, right? 
Chrissie Williamson: It does depend. None of the studies, or most of the studies, do not control for genotype. So, this study actually came out, it was a cardiology study and thank god, finally they said it depends on your genotype. Woo! Oh my gosh! So, it's the APOE4. So, if you've paid attention to Alzheimer's disease or cardiovascular disease or playing in the sandbox at all, you've heard of this snip. But heart disease and Alzheimer's are basically controlled by the same gene, and so it's the saturated fat gene or it's a fat carrier gene. Um, and the way I describe this is that, when you – and I said, um [laughs]. I was trying not to say um [laughs]. When you have this fat carrier gene, um – I did it again. You have this fat carrier gene... and we're going to laugh about this. For those of you who are watching this, I was really trying not to say um this time, um, it is a habit of mine and I'm really trying not to.
Rebekah Kelley: I think it's adorable. Keep it up! 
Chrissie Williamson: I'm going to blush and turn red this time. So the fat carrier gene, if you have a broken fat carrier gene, or you carry the number 4 allele for this, when it has fat on it and it gets blocked or lodged in your brain or in your arteries, when this happens, then that's when it causes inflammation. And that's how we get, essentially, Alzheimer's or cardiovascular disease. So the way that we prevent that – unfortunately, we don't know how to modulate this particular gene – we just don't eat saturated fat. Pretty simple, okay? So this decreases our risk for those two diseases and things like type 2 diabetes, et cetera, ad nauseum.
If you're luckier you carry the neutral allele, the number 3 allele, then saturated fat's not such a big deal for you. Now interestingly, the APOE2 allele actually carries some risks. So you don't quite get off the hook if you're one of those rare people, and I actually have this gene, too. If you have two of those, then you're in big trouble, then you have something called beta dyslipidemia. So that can be problematic, too. 
But I guess the point here is that when we're looking at whether or not fat is good for you or bad for you and how it can actually express in terms of your disease risk, you really do have to look at genes. 
Now, how does that actually translate into weight? Well, we end up looking at a whole bunch of different genes. So one gene does not equal disease in most cases. We end up having to look at hundreds of different genes. So the super nerds over at NGI [Nutritional Genomics Institute], we tend to look at these giant algorithms, and then we look at biomarkers that correlate with these algorithms. So when we're looking at things like whether or not you're at risk for yo-yo dieting, for instance, we look at a certain gene called ADIPOQ that regulates adiponectin. So, if you happen to have variations and a gene like adiponectin, then if you happen to even get overweight at one point... So let's just say you've lost 30 pounds or you're those people that happen to have been on The Biggest Loser and you've lost a 100 pounds, and you have issues and this adiponectin gene, your fat cells are literally like Kate from the Titanic, ""Come back, come back!"" and they're crying and screaming and throwing a hormonal hissy fit. Now that gene plays with the leptin receptor gene, who also plays with the ghrelin gene, and it literally will sit there and say, oh, we're going to make you be really hungry. And then we're going to make you be cranky if you don't get fat or sugar, that we're throwing up in your stomach right now. And so it will give you this hormonal cascade, make you feel miserable, if you don't get that. And you don't want to be around anybody who is feeling like that, I promise you. 
So there are all kinds of things that can actually influence your weight. The good news is, is that we do know how to modulate a lot of those genes. 
Rebekah Kelley: Thank god! 
Chrissie Williamson: Yes, thank god for that. So, there are all kinds of little tweaks that we can do to play with the leptin genes or play with the ghrelin genes, play with adiponectin genes. There are all kinds of what I'll call aces in the hole, like ashwagandha and astragalus. There's all kinds of cool little things that we can do, depending on your particular cascade of genes. 
So, all of those things impact your weight. All of those impact your weight maintenance, which is also super important. It's not just your ability to lose weight, it's your ability to maintain that weight loss. That's really important for longevity and health. 
Rebekah Kelley: Wow. Wow. So how can then genomic testing help determine the best diet for somebody, or what eating approach they need for their body, whether they're losing weight, whether they're maintaining. I mean, you've kind of given an example of the cascade that can happen. How has that then best determined? 
Chrissie Williamson: To be honest, I think it all starts with inflammation. And for me, there are five pillars of inflammation when it comes to diet. One of those is fats, which we touched on. The other ones are oxalates, salicylates, sulfur and histamine. Those last four, most people have never heard of before. 
We can't really measure a lot of those in traditional testing. Histamines, you might be able to measure if you have true mass cell activation disorder. So plasma histamine, elevated IgE tryptase levels, those types of things. But histamine intolerance? Most people don't really know. You know, a lot of times you're going to have some anxiety. You might have a little interstitial cystitis, or for women, you might feel like your bladder is kind of quivering all the time. You might have diarrhea after you eat, more often than not. Most people don't necessarily think about it that way. Most of them think, oh, histamine, rash, and they're going to be covered in hives. That's not really what histamine intolerance is. 
We have other things like oxalates, for instance. So unless you have a history of kidney stones, most people have never heard of oxalates. But oxaluria ends up causing fibromyalgia-like symptoms in most people, and osteoporosis. So, there are all these things that we can see on some of our ""fancy"" functional testing and those are things that are nice to see, but really and truly, when we look at genetics, we're able to have some predictability on those things. So we're able to go, aha, we see this pattern in our genes and we're able to identify some of these inflammatory pillars without having to necessarily use some of those fancy tests that may not be available for most people. Direct-to-consumer genetic testing is cheap, effective, and really easy and accessible to just about everybody. It's one of those things where, if we can identify what some of these inflammatory pillars are, we can decrease our disease risk astronomically.
Rebekah Kelley: Wow. You know, I have one more question and this is a question that, we didn't discuss, I'm just throwing it in here as a surprise for you [both laugh], but I would love to kind of know, what's kind of your vision for the future of personalized nutrition? Because that gets to kind of the essence of what we're talking about at Humanized Health. And I think it also gets to what you're really focused in doing, with your business. So what do you think the future might look like? 
Chrissie Williamson: Hmm. So, there's kind of a blend between like what they were trying to do at Theranos, and that is one of those things where we do need to scale. We need to have a, I would say, a blend of AI, that kind of goes forward, but we also need to, as a society, make sure the snake doesn't eat the tail. We have to make sure that the AIs don't kind of out-rule, and the robots don't end up ruling the humans here. So I think that's something we have to be really cautious about. But we do need super computers that are able to compute all of the different algorithms that go along with looking at, okay, this one gene here, this one alteration and this gene spins off 15, 20 different biomarkers and how all of those things interact. And we need to be able to have a patient walk into their primary care's office that takes insurance. They need to be able to do that without having to come to a specialist, and for that doctor to be able to say, oh, you fill up these three buckets of inflammation. You should be able to have this particular diet, and by the way, you are allergic to these types of medications or you have impairments in this types of medications, and this is your optimal exercise. These are the things, these are the basic things that you should be doing for optimal health. And that should be a basic, first initial appointment with any physician that you go to see. This should not be a specialty appointment. You shouldn't have to come to a specialty practice to get that kind of information.
So ideally, that would be, what I would like to see as the future of medicine. 
Rebekah Kelley: I really love the sense of empowerment that that would give somebody, where you're not just guessing, because you look around at your family and you think, oh, I may or may not have to be dealing with this. But you actually know what that looks like and what the steps might be to take charge of your life in so many ways. I love that. That's beautiful. Thank you, Dr. Chrissie.

Rebekah Kelley: Welcome to the Humanized podcast, all about personalizing your health. I'm your host, Rebekah Kelley. We have a great guest today, Dr. Nasha Winters. Before I introduce Dr. Winters I want to remind everyone to subscribe to get all our variety of casts in audio, video and transcription, at HumanizedHealth.com. I'd also like to thank our lead sponsor, Village Green Apothecary, at MyVillageGreen.com. 

So a little bit about Dr. Nasha Winters. She is a naturopathic doctor, fellow of the American Board of Naturopathic Oncology, acupuncturist, author, global health care authority on integrative cancer research. She's been on a personal journey with cancer for the last 27 years. At the age of 19, she was diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian cancer and given only a few months to live. Her quest to save her own life has transformed into a mission to support others on a similar journey. Wow, that says so much in such a short amount of time.

So the topic that we're covering today is her Introduction to the Terrain Ten. So welcome, Dr. Winters. It's so nice to have you here. 

Nasha Winters: Thank you, Rebekeh. It's a joy to be with all of you. I love what you're creating here. 

Rebekah Kelley: Thank you, thank you – so do I. So, can you please share your Terrain Ten? 

Nasha Winters: Sure. Terrain Ten is nothing special, nothing really new. It's just the way I sort of think about it and approach it for my own health and that of the patients I've supported over the years, and now for the doctors that I trained in this methodology. And simply put, these are sort of the 10 drops in the bucket, if you will, that each of us are exposed to that either make us thrive or dive with our health, or our health expression. And so simply put, it revolves around these 10 sort of patterns, if you will. 

So, epigenetics, being what was handed down to you from previous generations. Remember that epi, ""above,"" genetics, ""the gene,"" does not imply that it's something stagnant, it's actually quite dynamic and really takes its cue from us, from our environment. So epigenetics is one of the drops in the bucket. 

Number two, metabolic. Simply put, this is what fuel source do we feed our body to help our engine keep on humming and driving us down the road. So that means that it could be sugar, fat, protein – it could be a lot of different things, but it could also be other information from food, water, air, thoughts, coming in to change our metabolic expression. But mostly we look at it as what we ingest day by day in our food. 

Number three, we look at our toxicants. Holy cow. It's no longer a matter of if you have toxicity, it's how bad is it. How much are you being exposed to, aware or unaware, and how does it interact with your own personal bucket, if you will. 

And then number four, the microbiome. This has become a really hot topic in the last few years, despite the fact that Ayurvedic practitioners, Chinese medicine, naturopathic doctors, have really talked about ""the tube"" that has a body wrapped around it, for thousands of years. But this is how our body deals with other information coming in, and it's very important in the function of our immune system, which happens to be the next drop in the bucket. 

We are really talking about immunity a lot these days, with this incredible pandemic that's kind of put us all on the same playing field. It really does come down to how our personal immune systems are responding or reacting to the environment around us. So we really work with that when we're assessing people's terrain.

And then five is inflammation. We kind of are known as the ""inflammation nation"" these days. Many of the chronic illnesses we're dealing with today that take our lives are around inflammatory processes. We used to die from infections 150 years ago. Today we die of inflammatory processes – cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, Alzheimer's, cancer, to be exact. 

And then we look at angiogenesis, which also is around circulation and oxygenation. So how well are we perfusing the tissues in our body and bringing fresh oxygen to the tissues, which also helps us take out the garbage, dump things into our lymphatics.

And then the last three are really our hormonal health. This is not just about what hormones we have in our body, but how our body reacts, kind of in the symphony of the hormonal milieu, as well as how we're being exposed to many things in our environment today that are known as endocrine or hormonal disruptors, and how that plays out in our body.

And then finally, sort of that circadian rhythm stress response, which, living on Western planets these days, we are always under stress – but how we respond to it is also key. 

And the 10th drop in the bucket is often the most important, often the most difficult to address, is that mental, emotional health framework. Again, something that we are all aware of, but we don't tend to want to jump there first. We'd like to deal with the tangibles before we start to deal with the intangible. 

So there you have it. Those are the 10 main drops in the bucket that affect the way we thrive or die with regards to our health. 

Rebekah Kelley: I love that. I love the way you look at it – all of it. As you went through it verbally, I thought through each one in my life, and I'm like, oh yeah, that's right, I'm working on that, I'm working on that. Wow. So, what inspired this... I mean, this is an amazing Terrain Ten ideology and methodology.

Nasha Winters: Thank you. Well, you kind of gave it away in the intro, which is my own health journey, which actually is now nearly 30 years – I need to update my bio – October of 2021 will be 30 years since I was diagnosed with terminal ovarian cancer, stage 4 ovarian cancer, and was not given any options because I was so far gone. I was so in stage. And so instead of deciding that I was going to fix it and combat it, I wanted to understand it. And that's what's led to nearly a 30-year journey of me getting curious and starting to explore my own terrain. And each time I learned about another drop in my own bucket, it seems like I was able to kick the can down the road a little bit further. And here we are nearly three decades later and over 10,000 patients later, that I've had the privilege of helping explore their own Terrain Ten drops in the bucket. So it kind of just came into what's going on in me and why, and what can I do about it? 

Rebekah Kelley: And then you're helping all these other people because you've gone through this process yourself. Wow. 

Nasha Winters: Yeah. Yeah. 

Rebekah Kelley: That's amazing. So how can this now be applied? If someone's personalizing their health, their walk, what they need – how can this be applied? 

Nasha Winters: I love this question because I think when my book, The Metabolic Approach to Cancer, came out, I think a lot of people didn't pick up the book because they saw the word cancer and they thought, ""That's not me, I don't have to worry about that."" But really the book was written to PREVENT folks getting cancer, or to help people who have cancer navigate it a bit differently. Or after they've completed treatment, prevent it from coming back again. So this really should be sort of the metabolic approach to everything, or the metabolic approach to health or life, etc. But ultimately it applies in all arenas. 

I alluded to a moment ago, inflammation is what is the main way that takes our life these days on the planet. It's the same thing with metabolic diseases. A lot of times we think metabolic diseases, we think diabetes, we think obesity – but we also need to think about cardiovascular disease, cancer, Alzheimer's ADD, ADHD, autism, any of those neurological functions, auto-immune issues – those are really the drivers that all have the same underpinning of a metabolic imbalance. 

And so starting to look under the hood before you have a disease process so big and so loud to capture your attention, start to look before you have problems. I always use the analogy of look and deal with the little embers smoldering in your basement versus waiting until the whole house is engulfed in flames. And of course our medical system is very, very, very good at dealing with a house engulfed in flames. We're fantastic at emergency care. You know, I do not want to be treating someone who had just had a car accident. I, as a naturopathic oncologist, that is not a proper place for me to step in and support. But with regard to true prevention and helping people become aware of their blind spots and helping them create an internal soil and internal milieu that is not welcoming to disease processes or those sort of toxic drops in the bucket, that's where we shine in the integrative alternative functional medical model. And so that's where I want to teach people. And this applies across all of those disease processes we talked about.  

Rebekah Kelley: As you talk, there's so much that relates – and I'm sure you hear a lot of people say this, right? This relates to my own family history in a lot of ways. My father passed away at 42 from cancer, my mom and my grandmother, and pretty much everyone on the female side has had a battle. And so it's something that I grew up really aware of and trying to pay attention to. But even though I know these things and I'm very proactive, and whenever I talk to my healthcare providers, I'll be like, what can I do for preventative care? They really don't have a lot to help me with. They'll say, well, we can check your DNA. You know, you can get this tested, right? But I want to be even sooner. I want those earlier flags, and I know some things, because I've been so diligent, and of course, you know, my mom actually became a raw food vegan as soon as my dad had issues. It's one of those things where you start looking at your diet, like you talk about your Terrain Ten, but there are so many other things that you've brought up and it's hard to really figure out how to be preventative.

So my question is, where do you start? I mean, obviously your book, right? But where do you start with finding these things that then can be applied to your healthcare so you can personalize your experience and your history and, you know, not wait until things are on fire. 

Nasha Winters: I love that question. First of all, thank you for sharing your history. It's going to be very compelling for other people because sadly, you're not alone in that experience. And, and, you know, even the World Health Organization says that worldwide, our cancer rates are expected to double by 2030. And right now, one in two men, one in 2.4 women in the United States are expected to have cancer in their lifetime. So it is only a matter of time before we're facing it. 

So as you stated, what can I do tonight? And so, so much of that is taking a personal inventory, looking at everything you put in, on and around your body. At the beginning of my book, I have a 10-part questionnaire that is basically addressing 10 questions for each of those Terrain Ten patterns, and questions that you likely wouldn't be thinking about, or that you wouldn't typically see, kind of in the general public arena. It starts to help you understand where your blind spots are. I encourage people to look at that and then see what their priority is – because you could hit it all and you would likely need to, but you might want to start with the most obvious first, and then work your way down the path. That's really key. It will be different for everyone. You could even put 10 women with breast cancer, with the same type of breast cancer in the same demographic in the same room, and they'll all have different reasons of why they got there. They'll even have different molecular markers and different epigenetic underpinnings, and different labs and life experiences. Their biographies' impact on their biology is really critical. So I start to look at that. I want people to start to run basic tests every year. You want to run your vitamin D3. You want to run your insulin and your hemoglobin A1C. Those two things – if you address that aspect, your immune system and your metabolic health, you abort most of the chronic conditions we are faced with today.

A lot of people think they eat well and think they eat low carbohydrate, and yet they don't at all. And so those are some places. Using things like a macro nutrient counter, a free app online, the dminder app online to understand how much vitamin D you're actually getting exposed to, moving your body every day to some degree is key.

So these are just some of the examples that folks need to start to take a little personal responsibility and a little personal inventory, and start to audit everything around them. If you're still using glyphosate in your gardens, that's a problem. Right? And so these are the types of things that I want you and your listeners to be listening to. It's like, okay, what can I do about it now? 

Rebekah Kelley: Wow. Thanks Dr. Winters.

Magdalena Wzselaki, CH, HHC

Rebekah Kelley: Welcome to the Humanized Podcast, Your Health Personalized. I'm your host, Rebekah Kelley. Today I'm excited to talk with our guest, Magdalena Wszelaki.

Before I introduce Magdalena, I want to remind everyone to subscribe, to get all our variety of casts in audio, video and transcription at HumanizedHealth.com. I'd also like to thank our lead sponsor, Village Green Apothecary at MyVillageGreen.com.

A little bit about our guest. Magdalena Wszelaki is the founder of Hormones Balance, a thriving, online community dedicated to helping women balance hormones naturally. Magdalena is a nutrition coach, certified herbalist, a published best-selling cookbook author, speaker and educator. She is passionate about helping women find hormone balance with her food, books, online programs and education.

Thank you so much, Magdalena, for being here with us. We're so excited.

Magdalena Wszelaki: Thank you. I'm super excited about anyone who wants to talk about something that bothers almost 90% of the women out there in some way. And yet nobody's talking about it.

Rebekah Kelley: No one is. But you wrote a book about it, Overcoming Estrogen Dominance. Thank you, first off – as a woman, I'm so appreciative. When I read it, it was eye-opening. I've already started implementing some of your suggestions. I want to ask you, what led you to writing Overcoming  Estrogen Dominance?

Magdalena Wszelaki: Two main reasons. One is my own story with estrogen dominance. Also, I've had family members on both sides die from estrogenic  cancers. They had estrogen dominance for a very long time.

I realized, talking to my parents, that no woman in our family on either side has held onto her uterus after age 45 or 50. So it is my own story. But also, it is a highly underestimated space and no one is really talking about it. It's kind of normalized.

If you have fibroid and lumpy breasts or thyroid nodules or other different symptoms of estrogen dominance, it's dismissed as just part of being a woman. If you've got PMS, it's part of being a woman. I've discovered through my own research that, A) that's not necessary and, B) you can do a lot of things to reverse it.

Rebekah Kelley: So true. Why do you think people aren't talking about estrogen dominance as a cause of women's health issues? I feel like it's a vacuum.

Magdalena Wszelaki: I think it's because, largely, there was no speficic pill, no one pill that can solve all of that. The best we can do is put women on birth control pills, which were designed for contraception and not for medical conditions. Or they can put us on anti-depressants or anti-anxiety medication when you're having that time of the month. I think we've only had just those specific solutions. And as you know, allopathic medicine doesn't focus on things like balancing your gut health or supporting your liver, which is so instrumental in estrogen dominance.

Rebekah Kelley: Right. What types of testing do you recommend for women who are struggling with potential estrogen dominance symptoms?

Magdalena Wszelaki: The first thing I will say is that when I was in private practice, I had a lot of women walking in with their blood work and showing it to me and saying, ""Look, my doctor says I have no problem with hormones."" And yet this person would have a history of thyroid nodules and fibroids, or terrible PMS, or she had her period for 20 days in a month. All are symptoms screaming of estrogen dominance, yet she was told everything is fine. So, blood work for steroid hormones is a pretty useless diagnostic tool.

Much more effective, my favorite, is urine testing to show levels of estrogen. It also shows how your body breaks down those estrogens, which is really, really important. I also like saliva testing because that shows you the true levels of progesterone. In the case of estrogen dominance, the level of estrogen progesterone, it's actually really important to understand how these two correlate. And so saliva testing, it's a pretty decent test too.

Rebekah Kelley: Okay. Are there three things you would suggest women can do to start taking control of their hormone health?

Magdalena Wszelaki: There are so many more than three. But if we just want to talk about three, I think the first one that makes a huge difference is addressing how your body breaks down estrogen. Internally you produce estrogen already, right? And I just want to clarify one thing. Let's not demonize estrogen. I'm grateful for that term, ""estrogen dominance,"" that it is recognized as a condition, but it also misleads women to thinking that just because I have estrogen, it's a bad thing. I would not be here having a conversation in a meaningful way if our estrogen was too low. Right? As we know, when your estrogen is too low, you're going through menopause, which is no fun.

So estrogen is not to be blamed. There are various forms of estrogen dominance. One of the most signifiant to look at and understand is how your body breaks down estrogens, which makes a very big difference. You’ve got clean estrogens that are protective; they build, support and protect. And you have dirty estrogens that cause all the symptoms that we mentioned. Guess where predominantly the breakdown of estrogen happens? In our liver.

So to your top 3 points. The first is, support your liver. Look at your daily diet. Incorporating anything that is bitter and has a bitter taste to it can be a wonderful support for the liver.

I always say get rid of the lettuce in your salad; substitute that with bitter greens. That could be something like arugula or baby kale, or mustard greens. Chop up some turnips and radishes and put that into your salad. Put in things like corn or zucchini or cucumber, which are nutritionally on the lower side of the nutritional spectrum but with bitter quality.

The liver really loves the bitter, so use herbs that are of high bitter quality. Things like digestive bitters before a meal, or a burdock and dandelion roots tea after a meal. If you walk into a health food store, you find different herbal teas. Some of them that support the liver would have a lot of bitter herbs. And I will tell you, there are a number of women in our community who said that they didn't think of doing a tea like that, but once they started doing it, as part of our protocol, they said they'd gotten really addicted to it in a good way.

They just fell in love with it, they kept asking for it. Because they felt their bodies responding to it. They were saying things like, ""I'm so grateful when you have that tea,"" and, ""Bring it on!"" So I would say, bitters for the liver.

The second important point is that we should eliminate external sources of estrogen. Because that's always a big issue. Throw away all your skincare products that are from brands that advertise on television mass media, companies that can afford to be in top shelves in stores. They'll spend multimillions of dollars on advertising. Switch to brands that are really clean. You can look it up on the EWG.org website under ""skincare,"" the listing on how clean the skincare brands are – and there are so many of them.
Elimination of that is a huge thing.

The third thing is sleep. Having high quality, deep sleep is when your body rejuvenates, your liver has a break, you're producing new estrogens, and you're producing progestins. Getting sufficient sleep, and fixing your sleep, for a lot of women after they reach 35, 40 or 45 years of age, when sleep starts declining, is a problem. Fixing that is something that I have found gives a lot of women great improvement.

Rebekah Kelley: Wow. Those are all wonderful suggestions. It's very hard to find bitter; you have to actually go out and find it because it's not necessarily something that we easily find on the menu typically.

Magdalena Wszelaki: As an herbalist, I'll be the first to say that the bitter flavor is a forgotten flavor in the Western culinary spectrum. We obviously have a lot of sweetness, we have a lot of salt. We have a little bit of sour. But bitterness is something that is frowned upon.  But once you bring it in, your body really starts feeling the difference, not just from a liver perspective, but your bowels improve. Your food is not just sitting there anymore. You start getting a lot more energy after having a meal. So the benefits are endless.

Rebekah Kelley: That's amazing. Why do you think that PMS is assumed to be just part of being a woman?

Magdalena Wszelaki: Yes. I think it's a big part of our culture. And to what I said earlier, it's because we don't have a solution to it, unless you're put on the pill. And a lot of women don't want to be put on the pill. I would say that's absolutely not necessary. What I want to acknowledge is that if you look at a chart of our hormones throughout a cycle, for a woman who is still menstruating, it goes up and down. I want to acknowledge that when you are going through that cycle, it's normal to have times of being really open and dynamic and want to exercise a lot. And there are times during a period when you really feel shut down. But it just means that you want to be quiet. Maybe you want to be alone. Maybe you don't want to go out and party and meet friends. But it doesn't mean you have to be in a fetal position on the floor with three bottles of painkillers, right? But let me tell you, when you do fix your estrogen dominance, your PMS becomes an event that occurs to you and it doesn't destroy your life.

Rebekah Kelley: Right. Well, how about on the other side? Why do women in menopause with low estrogen often experience estrogen dominance?
Because it seems counterintuitive. If your estrogen is going down, how are you estrogen dominant?

Magdalena Wszelaki: That's a very common question we get on our website, and it's a valid question. We have a quiz and people ask, ""I'm in menopause and I'm estrogen dominant? I think there is something wrong with your quiz!""

It's nothing wrong with our quiz. You can be estrogen dominant. And if you think about it, most breast cancers in developed countries are due to estrogen dominance. We call it estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. And the highest demographic are women 55- 75. If you think about it, those women have very low estrogen, so estrogen dominance can happen. As your hormones drop, how you break down those estrogens, however little you have of them, still makes a difference.

As we age, our liver does, too. And if our liver is unsupported for all these years, then it makes it much harder for the body to break down estrogen. So you can be low in estrogen, but still breaking it down in unfavorable ways, producing too many dirty estrogens. The second way this can happen is that even though both estrogen and progesterone drop during this time, progesterone unfortunately drops faster and more-so than estrogen does. So the proportion of estrogen to progesterone in menopausal years tends to be very unbalanced.

Think of estrogen and progesterone as two dancing partners. You can watch it down to the end of the competition; if the guy is too flamboyant and overdressed, and the woman is timid, it doesn't look right. Right? You have to dance together.

She's passionate about helping women find hormone balance with her books, online programs and education. 
Thank you so much for being with us, Magdalena. 
Magdalena Wszelaki: My pleasure. Thank you. 
Rebekah Kelley: So what are fibroids? What causes them to grow since we're learning how to shrink them? 
Magdalena Wszelaki: So the good news about fibroids is that they are not carcinogenic. So they are not cancer cells, typically. And so that's the good news about them. The bad news is that it can really be debilitating, they can be causing a lot of very heavy periods, that it can be very painful to have sex, it can be causing a lot of bleeding, there's a lot of discomfort. But for me, as a health practitioner, it is also an indication that a woman has estrogen dominance. 
And so you asked what is estrogen dominance, and the in the context of fibroids, it's essential to understand that fibroids grow. It's a muscle tissue that grows, that has got a huge number of receptors on it for estrogen. And so, not all estrogens are bad. Estrogen dominance is when... the name is kind of not the most favorable thing for women because it kind of makes us be afraid of estrogen. And the truth is that estrogen itself is a good thing and we need it as women to function, period. But, it's how you break down those estrogens, can make a very big difference. And so for simplicity, I like to think of it that estrogen, it needs to be metabolized to clean and to dirty estrogens. Those clean are protective, is what gives you beautiful hair, brain function, sleep, bones, cardiovascular health, periods, nice bust. And the dirty estrogen is what's causing a lot of the different symptoms, including period problems, heavy periods, absent periods, hot flashes, fibroids, endometriosis, thyroid nodules, a lot of estrogenic cancers are due to estrogen dominance. 
So fibroids in themselves might not be a dangerous occurrence. However, it's an indication that your body is struggling with metabolizing those estrogens and the growth of the fibroid happens because of the excess estrogen that is in the body. And you know, a lot of time women who have fibroids also have a lot of other symptoms of estrogen dominance, like the ones that I mentioned. And there's many more. And that's something that... I like to work on this early. I would urge women to work on this as early as possible to resolve it, even though it's benign, because it is something that, you just don't want to go down the path of developing other estrogen dominant symptoms. Some of them can be life debilitating and change your life upside-down. Like for example, developing breast cancer. 
Rebekah Kelley: So how do women develop estrogen dominance? 
Magdalena Wszelaki: So there's a lot of ways and none of them is exclusive, meaning they're not mutually exclusive. There can be just one thing causing it, or it can be a whole bunch of things causing it. But predominantly, the biggest one, there is an element of a genetic predisposition. So if your mom has had fibroids, you might be also predisposed to having fibroids. However, this is not a given, there's a lot of things you can do with lifestyle changes and diet and supplements and herbs to reverse it and never have it come back. So, genetic elements. 
The other ones would definitely be things like women who are on birth control, including progesterone – only progestin kind of birth control, because progestin actually activates, over-sensitizes your estrogen receptors, as well. So your estrogen receptors are much more likely to uptake estrogen, as well.
Women who are using a lot of skincare cleaning products that are from the main brands, that are not organic, clean, and a lot of the, what we call xenoestrogens occurring, so those are externally occurring – fake, synthetic estrogen can also create a lot of havoc, including estrogen dominance.
The health of your liver and your gut can really play a profound role. You know how I talked about the clean and dirty estrogens. Well guess what? The synthesis and the breakdown of these estrogens happens in the gut and the liver. And so as we age, it's very normal for our, both gut and liver to get a little more sluggish. And so there's a factor there, too. 
Stress can be another huge factor. Stress robs you of progesterone and one of the forms of estrogen dominance is that your progesterone to estrogen ratio, it goes off balance. And so a lot of women feel, for example, whenever they go through a stressful period, for example, their periods are getting a lot worse, the PMS is getting a lot worse, the fibroids for example, could grow a lot significantly faster during this time. 
I would say those are the major reasons. 
Rebekah Kelley: So what are some of the natural treatment options for fibroids, then? 
Magdalena Wszelaki: So I think one of the big things a lot of us do, and I'm a culprit here too, is when you have a symptom, the first thing is like, what's the one herb, what's the one supplement that I can run off to, take it and quickly get a result? And the truth is that there are some – I'm happy to mention a couple of them – but I've also noticed that they would only work short term. If you want a long-term solution, it calls for a little bit more, I would say, deep transition in your life. And the biggest thing, biggest thing is changing your diet is going to make the most profound long-term effect. So getting on an anti-inflammatory diet that reduces or completely eliminates inflammatory foods, such as gluten, dairy, reduces sugar, if you're sensitive to eggs, the removal of eggs, soy and corn... Any other food sensitivities you already know, you have, like if you can't do bananas, don't eat bananas. If you can't have seeds, don't need seeds, right? Just reducing the inflammation is going to really offload your liver and your gut, and that's where that estrogen metabolism happens, that I explained earlier. So that can be a huge thing. 
The other thing women who have fibroids can really benefit from is by supporting their liver. And so you can support your liver through, first of all, the elimination diet – an anti-inflammatory diet is going to help a whole bunch. The second thing is, adding things like, for example, magnesium, a B vitamin. But also certain herbs, like dandelion root and chicory root and andrographis, or artichoke leaf, are some of the classical bitters that have incredible efficacy on helping you to support your liver. And that way you're going to also be much more effectively metabolizing those dirty estrogens that are causing the growth of those fibroids. 
And the third strategy I would say is adding herbs that are astringent. So, astringency. And think of it this way. The fibroids grow because there is blood flow into the... It's actually one of the medical procedures that women get on reducing fibroids, is getting an embolism done, meaning that you cut off the supply, the blood supply to the uterus, sorry to the fibroid, in order to shrink it. Which is, I think it's very... well, I know for a fact, it's a short-term strategy because you might end up getting a fibroid on the other side of your uterus if you're not addressing the root cause, which is estrogen dominance. But what's interesting about the blood supply procedure that I talked about, the embolism, is that you can achieve something similar with herbs, by just making the astringency, creating astringency around a uterus so the blood flow doesn't flow there as profusely. So some of those, my two favorites will be yarrow and red clover. And so you can easily do that in the form of tinctures, or red clover is a wonderful tea to drink. It tastes almost like a black tea, just a really wonderful infusion you can just make and sip on that throughout the day.
Again, this is a short-term strategy because if you're just depending on astringent herbs, and then the minute you remove them, and you don't address the root causes of estrogen dominance, most likely that fibroid is going to come back. So, one of the things I'll just mention in terms of supplements, there is a wonderful supplement that's called serrapeptase. It's more anecdotal than the research on it, but I feel like just because there's no research on something yet, it doesn't mean that we shouldn't be paying attention to it. It's a form of an enzyme that actually shows that it chomps down on the tissue of the thyroid. So these kinds of serrapeptase enzymes can be super beneficial for women. 
So, if you combine those few strategies together, a bit of dietary changes, supporting your liver, and then adding a couple of those supplements I talked about, generally I see women getting amazing results within one or two months, going for another checkup and having their OB-GYN go, oh, wow, whatever you're doing, just keep doing it because it's been shrinking significantly. Sometimes it's from two inches going down to one inch in diameter, literally within a month of just following the protocol like that. 
Rebekah Kelley: Wow. So it really shows that what you're choosing to eat, the environment you're creating is you're going to feed or starve the fibroid.
Magdalena Wszelaki: Absolutely. Absolutely. 
Rebekah Kelley: And then you mentioned some of the herbs. Are there any others that you would want to mention to use to shrink fibroids or did you pretty much cover them there? 
Magdalena Wszelaki: I think, the main ones, I think those are the main... in my book, Overcoming Estrogen Dominance, I'm just going to take a quick look at that. So, you know, if you're working with an herbalist, I do recommend, I have a whole protocol in my book on fibroids. So dandelion root, burdock root. 
Rebekah Kelley: Will you hold the book up so we can see it? Overcoming Estrogen Dominance. Yeah, it helps for whenever you go on Amazon. 
Magdalena Wszelaki: And fibroids is one of the chapters. So dandelion root, burdock root, gentian and andrographis are great for liver support, chasteberry and black cohosh for rebuilding your progesterone level, uterine astringents like yarrow, cinnamon, cranesbill and red raspberry. And then uterine tonics, herbs that promote overall balance of the uterus, are blue cohosh, motherwort and red raspberry leaf again. 
So, yeah, it's good to work with an herbalist to put a formula together, and that can create, like I said, quite amazing results without all the… I mean, Western medicine has, we always say how it’s got its place. And this is going to be one of those conditions that I would, I would defer from using it. [Laughs]
